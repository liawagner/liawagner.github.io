        <h2>Kitty Hawk</h2>
        <p class="post-date">August 10, 2013</p>

        <p>I just arrived home from a wonderful vacation in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Kristin and I treated ourselves to an oceanfront room right at the entryway to the outer banks. We did what we intended - explored the local places to eat and hung out on the beach. Nothing more, nothing less! The weather cooperated for the most part, and I was able to try about five different coffee places.</p>

<p>It was certainly fantastic to wake up to this view every morning:</p>

<p>Here are the dining highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://duckdonuts.com/" title="The best donuts ever">Duck Donuts</a> - The best donuts ever. Made to order and piping hot. I recommend the maple. The coffee wasn&rsquo;t anything to call home about, though.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.waveriderscoffeeanddeli.com/" title="Waverider's Coffee and Deli">Waveriders Coffee</a> - Now this is a place to call home about. The coffee here was the best I&rsquo;ve had in a long time. By the smell of the place, they roast it there. This is opposed to a bunch of other places that buy beans from Kill Devil Coffee. They make a pretty mean egg bagel sandwich as well. Best of all, they have comfy couches upon which to rest your sandy butt after an early morning photography session!</li>
<li><a href="http://blackpelican.com/cms/" title="The Black Pelican">The Black Pelican</a> - Hands down my favorite seafood restaurant in the area. It&rsquo;s always hopping, even at 6PM. It is worth the wait.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.obbrewing.com/" title="Outer Banks Brewing Station">Outer Banks Brewing Station</a> - Beer aficionados look no further. This is a micro-brewery featuring some award winning (read: tasty) beers. As a bonus the entire place runs off of wind turbine located in the back of the premises. I had the &ldquo;Nitwit&rdquo; witbier and enjoyed every drop. This place fills up quickly, but fortunately the bar is full service and has a quick turnover rate.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.obxtacobar.com/" title="Outer Banks Taco Bar">Outer Banks Taco Bar</a> - Unassuming and small, this place still packs a punch if you&rsquo;re into Mexican food. The fish tacos were amazing, and the queso had some kick!</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a couple of things I will do differently next time. For one, I will make sure to bring my quality pair of sunglasses. Mere minutes from the house I noted that I had left my glasses behind, yet I did not turn around - mistaaaaaake! The cheap sunglasses I bought at the surf shop hurt my head and didn&rsquo;t cut the sun out very well. They at least allowed me to drive.</p>

<p>Another mistake would be bringing spray-based sunblock. The spray stuff from Wegmans stung our eyes and did not fend off the sun as well as a cream. In other words, the convenience of the spray was entirely nullified by its lack of effectiveness. Cream costs less, lasts longer, and does what it is supposed to do (you know, <em>block</em> the sun).</p>

<p>Lastly, I should really consider bringing special shoes to run on the beach. I ran on the beach twice during the trip and I had pain on both occasions. Some sand booties would help there.</p>

<p>Overall I am very impressed with the selection of stuff to do there. Although I have visited the place frequently since I was young, OBX continues to surprise me with its variety of shops and sights. I will have to set aside a bit more time in the future for more exploration of the southern end. This trip I was entirely focused on relaxation, so I am okay with leaving more than a few things undone. See you next year, OBX!</p>
