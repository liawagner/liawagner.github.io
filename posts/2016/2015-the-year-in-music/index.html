        <h2>2015: The Year In Music</h2>
        <p class="post-date">January 3, 2016</p>

        

<p>Another year of music is in the bag. 2015 was a good one! Once again we crack
open <a href="https://gist.github.com/antzucaro/8212369">summarizr</a> to see
what we have&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="which-artists-did-we-listen-to-the-most">Which artists did we listen to the most?</h3>

<ol>
<li>Nine Inch Nails (261)</li>
<li>Frank Turner (246)</li>
<li>Tame Impala (227)</li>
<li>deadmau5 (225)</li>
<li>Awolnation (158)</li>
<li>Coldplay (156)</li>
<li>Metallica (146)</li>
<li>Pink Floyd (142)</li>
<li>Less Than Jake (136)</li>
<li>The War on Drugs (129)</li>
</ol>

<p>The stats this year are a bit skewed because I replaced my Revo 3700
 (a full-sized computer) with a
 Raspberry Pi 2 (a credit card sized computer) to save a bit on power. In the process I converted from using
 MPD to Kodi, and I didn&rsquo;t take the time until recently to address Last.FM
 scrobbling with the latter. Oh well, it is still interesting!</p>

<p>So <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails">NiN</a> comes in at the top spot this year. I think this is mostly me listening
 to &ldquo;The Fragile&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hesitation Marks&rdquo; at work. I find both of those
 albums familiar enough that they don&rsquo;t distract me while coding, yet still
 block out enough of the ambient office noise to make a difference with respect
 to flow.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Turner">Frank Turner</a> is the real newcomer here. I came across his stuff while perusing
 CDs at the Cascades Library. The particular album was &ldquo;England Keep My Bones,&rdquo;
 and I fell in love immediately. I went out and purchased his catalog as soon
 as I could, and I haven&rsquo;t regretted a minute of it. He has a fantastic voice
 and moving lyrics. I highly recommend him!</p>

<p>My other crush of the year was with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala">Tame Impala</a>, who released their (yes, I
 know it is
 really one guy) album &ldquo;Currents&rdquo; after much anticipation. It was and is
 everything I expected, and has been in constant rotation. My favorites from
 the album are &ldquo;The Less I Know the Better&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reality in Motion&rdquo;. Rock on!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Awolnation">AWOLNATION</a> came out with another one during the year as well, which didn&rsquo;t
 disappoint. I expected a good amount of weirdness along with his singing
 magnificence and that&rsquo;s what I got! Favorites from this one are &ldquo;Hollow Moon&rdquo;
 and &ldquo;Woman Woman.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="how-many-different-artists-did-we-listen-to">How many different artists did we listen to?</h3>

<p>502 (versus 727 last year)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to put too much stock into this figure for this year. I didn&rsquo;t
listen to nearly as much SomaFM and I ended my Spotify subscription as
well. This meant I was on my own media-wise. I have a broad and diverse
collection, but it can&rsquo;t compare to those of the larger services out there.
Oddly enough, Spotify spammed me to death towards the end of the year with a
three-for-one deal that I could have taken. If I knew the music-listening
situation at my new job, I might have agreed to it! As it stands I don&rsquo;t know
how musically oriented the office is, and I&rsquo;d rather not give off a bad
impression as &ldquo;the new guy with the headphones on all the time.&rdquo; Maybe next
time!</p>

<h3 id="how-many-tracks-did-we-listen-to-per-month">How many tracks did we listen to per month?</h3>

<ul>
<li>January: 978</li>
<li>February: 623</li>
<li>March: 1052</li>
<li>April: 1266</li>
<li>May: 822</li>
<li>June: 726</li>
<li>July: 891</li>
<li>August: 845</li>
<li>September: 554</li>
<li>October: 386</li>
<li>November: 278</li>
<li>December: 355</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at these numbers I can guess that I swapped computers at some point in
September. The scrobbling count dropped dramatically during that time! I didn&rsquo;t
even get my yearly boost from SomaFM&rsquo;s Christmas channel in December. Shame.</p>

<h3 id="which-artists-did-we-listen-to-the-most-by-month">Which artists did we listen to the most by month?</h3>

<ul>
<li>January: Toy (67)</li>
<li>February: Nine Inch Nails (46)</li>
<li>March: Frank Turner (94)</li>
<li>April: Ramin Djawadi (96)</li>
<li>May: Thomas Newman (84)</li>
<li>June: Pink Floyd (32)</li>
<li>July: Boston (37)</li>
<li>August: deadmau5 (189)</li>
<li>September: Metallica (40)</li>
<li>October: Nine Inch Nails (40)</li>
<li>November: Nine Inch Nails (45)</li>
<li>December: Coldplay (51)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Toy">Toy</a> takes January, when I was definitely on a psychedelic rock kick. I
think I came across them on Tame Impala&rsquo;s &ldquo;similar artists&rdquo; page. They take a
little getting used to, but remain a solid choice if you&rsquo;re a rock fan.</p>

<p>The composer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ramin+Djawadi">Ramin Djawadi</a> is another notable on this list. He did the
soundtrack for Game of Thrones, and with the show playing during the month we
certainly took advantage of the album. If you&rsquo;re in the mood to feel epic while
you&rsquo;re doing household chores, this is the guy to queue up.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy artist here is <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Boston">Boston</a>. After reading a random Reddit comment
about how the group recorded and produced their first album (in short: Tom
Scholz being amazing), I picked it up. I couldn&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t already have
it, given how amazing it is. Every single song on the album is still in
rotation on the ratio, even today. Crazy.</p>

<h3 id="what-song-did-we-listen-to-the-most">What song did we listen to the most?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+War+on+Drugs">The War on Drugs</a> - Under the Pressure (16 plays)</p>

<p>It is no surprise that I really like indie and psychedelic rock, so of course
this track makes sense. I love the way this guy blends different sounds
together, and that is immediately apparent in this track. Listen to it and
you&rsquo;ll see!</p>

<h3 id="how-many-different-artists-did-we-listen-to-per-month">How many different artists did we listen to, per month?</h3>

<ul>
<li>January - 75</li>
<li>February - 75</li>
<li>March - 102</li>
<li>April - 110</li>
<li>May - 88</li>
<li>June - 100</li>
<li>July - 118</li>
<li>August - 125</li>
<li>September - 92</li>
<li>October - 49</li>
<li>November - 58</li>
<li>December - 48</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with my diversity
for the year. I try not to get into any ruts, and it is clear that didn&rsquo;t
happen. Continued visits to the library and various thrift stores should help
to keep these numbers similar in 2016.</p>

<h3 id="what-album-did-we-listen-to-the-most">What album did we listen to the most?</h3>

<p>The War on Drugs - Lost in the Dream</p>

<p>Check this guy out. Indie rock at its best!</p>

<p>So there went 2015! All in all a pretty decent year of music. I look forward to
what 2016 brings, although I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve heard much about what to expect.
Maybe a new full-length album from the Foo Fighters or perhaps NiN? I&rsquo;ll be
happily grooving regardless.</p>
