        <h2>Weverton Cliffs in March</h2>
        <p class="post-date">March 23, 2014</p>

        <p>I always try to get a &ldquo;tune up&rdquo; hike in during March. It&rsquo;s a chance for me to make sure that I&rsquo;ve got the right suite of equipment for the upcoming Memorial Day hike. Despite doing this hike-then-camp stuff for going on a decade now, I somehow always end up coming back with some lessons learned. That&rsquo;s life, y&rsquo;know?</p>

<p>This time around I went back to one of my favorite local places - Weverton Cliffs - with my buddy Jerry from work. Jerry had recently purchased a hammock and wanted to give it an extra spin, having used it only once the weekend before. We departed from my house at around 12:30 with a plan to hike around 8 miles one-way.</p>

<p>It being a wonderfully sunny day, Harper&rsquo;s Ferry was jam packed with people. There was a nice breeze blowing through the town, and it carried us right across the bridge and onto the C&amp;O towpath on the other side. We waved to the turtles and plodded away on the most boring part of the hike. After 3 miles of dead-even trail, we abruptly turned left and marched up the mountain. It didn&rsquo;t take very long before we arrived at the cliffs. Once there, we chatted with the other folks that were also hanging out.</p>

<p>Jerry wanted to hike a bit more, so we put the cliffs on hold for a bit to visit the Ed Garvey shelter. Even though I thought it was only a mile or so away, in actuality it was about three. Once there we met a nice family with a gigantic mastiff named Katahdin. I read the trail log and Jerry explored. Before too long it was time to get back to the cliffs to set up for the night.</p>

<p>Upon climbing into my hammock after setting up, I noticed my first mistake: I&rsquo;d tied up to a tree that was too small. I was bobbing too much vertically, so I switched to another tree and called it complete. After that, I settled in for some couscous for dinner. Bringing a little bit of olive oil to butter it up worked really well as usual, so I will certainly continue that practice in May. One key thing that we both learned was to put the oil in AFTER the boil, else you&rsquo;ll risk a messy boil-over. Jerry gave the rocks some garlic and herb spices to taste because of that.</p>

<p>We hung out and watched the sun set before heading back up to camp. I took in the panoramic view from the lower cliffs.</p>

<p>The temperature was dipping into the 40s and it was time to get inside our respective sleeping bags. It took us a while to find our camp again in the dark, but Jerry had a sun-like torch to find the way, and I had my LED headlamp on its highest setting. We found the site after considerable bumbling and grumbling. I hopped into my bag and enjoyed the warmth.</p>

<p>Hours go by, and I&rsquo;m turning around in my bag as usual. My knees get tired of the lock-out, so I switch to my side for a bit. Unfortunately that makes my ass stick to a side of the hammock that isn&rsquo;t insulated, so then I get cold. Before long in that spot, I&rsquo;ll go back to my back. It was this kind of situation that led me into my first deep sleep of the night.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that deep sleep was interrupted with my ass hitting the cold and uncomfortable forest floor. My second mistake of the night had shown itself! I&rsquo;d picked a tree with very smooth bark, and my slap straps had slowly unraveled with my turning. To make matters worse, I let out a loud yelp once I actually hit the ground. It was so loud that I immediately apologized to Jerry for waking him up (I heard no response). I adjusted the straps and had a normal night thereafter.</p>

<p>Waking up in the morning, we congregated on the rocks for some black coffee. That&rsquo;s something I haven&rsquo;t done before, and it was phenomenal. I&rsquo;m definitely doing that in May!</p>

<p>On the way back to the car we passed again through lower Harper&rsquo;s Ferry. It was almost barren and bitter cold, making it the complete opposite of the day before. We hopped in the car and high-tailed it to <a href="http://stoneybrookfarm.org/wordpress/">Stoneybrook Farm and Market</a> for some breakfast. It was probably the best egg and provolone sandwich I&rsquo;ve had in my life, and I gobbled it down in no time. Jerry opted to get us (he bought - thanks Jerry!) a cinnamon roll too, which was also unbelievably good. I made a mental note to stop by there on my next hike in the area. Hopefully I don&rsquo;t have to wait until next March for another one of those!</p>
