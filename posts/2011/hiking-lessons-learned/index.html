        <h2>Lessons Learned From 2010&#39;s Hikes</h2>
        <p class="post-date">February 26, 2011</p>

        <p>I hike often when the weather permits. Despite all of my experience in the woods I still screw up often out there. Here are my things to improve upon in 2011, learned the hard way from mistakes made in 2010.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the temperature is going to be around 50F at night I don&rsquo;t need to bring the 10 degree bag. The 45 degree bag and some extra clothes will do just fine. I think I was a little too sweaty and uncomfortable last year because I figured the temperature would be approaching the limit of my bag. Not so! I can bring my warmth level up without having to bring out the big guns. I&rsquo;ll save the 10 degree bag for March hikes, when the temps can get down in the teens depending on how high up you are.</li>
<li>Bring three sets of clothes. In other words: two is not enough to remain dry. I sweat a lot, especially on hills. Being under the cover of trees doesn&rsquo;t exactly facilitate quick drying of clothes. On more than a few hikes I&rsquo;d have to get by on a soggy pair the next day because of this. Adding a third pair and using them in a rotating fashion works better. For socks, if possible hang the wettest pair on the outside of the pack so it can catch the breeze all day.</li>
<li>Dry food is really boring. Bring more &ldquo;wet&rdquo; food. Warm, non-brick food gives you a physical AND mental boost.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t buy the cheap zipper bags. They break easily, leaving your stuff at risk of getting wet. Find a thicker set of zipper bags to keep things safe.</li>
<li>Wear sock liners to avoid blisters. The second layer wicks moisture adds a little padding for more comfort.</li>
<li>Bring a super-absorbent cloth to towel off sweat during hikes on hot days. The sleeve of your shirt isn&rsquo;t cutting it. A super-light camping towel could do the job just fine, and it can fit in one of the side pockets of the pack.</li>
</ul>
