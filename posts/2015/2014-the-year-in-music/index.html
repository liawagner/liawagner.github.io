        <h2>2014: The Year In Music</h2>
        <p class="post-date">February 16, 2015</p>

        

<p>2015 is well underway, so it is time to reflect on last year&rsquo;s music landscape. I dusted off <a href="https://gist.github.com/antzucaro/8212369#file-summarizr-go">summarizr</a> to grab a data-centric view of my music world in 2014.</p>

<p>To start off&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="which-artists-did-we-listen-to-the-most">Which artists did we listen to the most?</h3>

<ol>
<li>Pink Floyd (262)</li>
<li>C418 (235)</li>
<li>Nine Inch Nails (200)</li>
<li>John Mayer (176)</li>
<li>Daft Punk (160)</li>
<li>Less Than Jake (150)</li>
<li>David Bowie (133)</li>
<li>Led Zeppelin (127)</li>
<li>Carbon Leaf (126)</li>
<li>Metallica (123)</li>
</ol>

<p>No surprises here. Pink Floyd came out with their mostly-ambient album <em>The Endless River</em> towards the end of the year and I listened the hell out of it. No shame there - they&rsquo;ve been my favorite band since high school and I&rsquo;m perfectly fine without Roger Waters&rsquo; egotism in the band. My favorite modern band, Nine Inch Nails, is always going to be on the list as well. They&rsquo;re a perfect fit for the kind of work I do at the computer. David Bowie is the only relatively newcomer on the list. I got into his greatest hits by chance and found myself going back to it again and again as the year went on.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-different-artists-did-we-listen-to">How many different artists did we listen to?</h3>

<p>727 (versus 591 last year)</p>

<p>This one was eye-opening. Every year I promise to myself to expand my musical horizons and end up listening to the same stuff. Last year I bucked that trend and I believe I have Spotify and Soma.fm to thank. I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of Pandora due to the lack of an official thick client, so Spotify fills that need quite nicely. Their radio advertisements are a small price to pay for an awesome app overall and it shows. I keep those streams a-streamin and my musical taste expands.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-tracks-did-we-listen-to-per-month">How many tracks did we listen to per month?</h3>

<p>January: 1056<br />
February: 533<br />
March: 740<br />
April: 922<br />
May: 642<br />
June: 1062<br />
July: 1073<br />
August: 483<br />
September: 882<br />
October: 862<br />
November: 528<br />
December: 621</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really draw much from this statistic, but I like to look at it nevertheless. I can only theorize that May and August are low in the totals department because of my yearly hike and vacation, respectively. Those are entire weeks where I&rsquo;m not hitting a web-accessible playlist. That&rsquo;s by choice and I&rsquo;ll keep doing the same next year.</p>

<h3 id="which-artists-did-we-listen-to-the-most-by-month">Which artists did we listen to the most by month?</h3>

<p>January: Carbon Leaf (40)<br />
February: Nine Inch Nails (34)<br />
March: John Mayer (61)<br />
April: C418 (89)<br />
May: Nine Inch Nails (72)<br />
June: The Doobie Brothers (67)<br />
July: C418  (72)<br />
August: Queen (26)<br />
September: Daft Punk (37)<br />
October: Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (43)<br />
November: The Rolling Stones (49)<br />
December: Pink Floyd (58)</p>

<p>This is probably my favorite set of stats because they really show my listening habits throughout the year. January began with a heavy dose of Carbon Leaf with their album <em>Ghost Dragon Attacks Castle</em>. Although the album came out just about one year prior, we weren&rsquo;t on their mailing list then and didn&rsquo;t notice. I certainly noticed in January. March is when I discovered a ton of free live shows from John Mayer on <a href="https://archive.org/details/JohnMayerMusic">archive.org</a>, so I was putting those to work. I like how you can pick shows from your area in particular - it is almost like being there! In July we watched <em><a href="http://www.minecraftstoryofmojang.com/">Minecraft: The Story of Mojang</a></em> and I fell in love (all over again) with C418. I ended up purchasing his albums <em>Minecraft: Volume Beta</em> and <em>One</em> and that meant a lot of logged tracks. October saw the release of the movie <em>Gone Girl</em> and along with it the soundtrack by two of my favorite artists, so that got heavy use as well. December saw the long-awaited release of Pink Floyd&rsquo;s <em>The Endless River</em> which had me immediately drooling. I&rsquo;m still drooling now over it, as a matter of fact! I&rsquo;ll probably play that album later today&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="what-song-did-we-listen-to-the-most">What song did we listen to the most?</h3>

<p>The Doobie Brothers (It Keeps You Runnin&rsquo;)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really have anything else to add here. What a weird track to have listened to the most! I have no explanation other than the Doobies are awesome in general. No shame.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-different-artists-did-we-listen-to-per-month">How many different artists did we listen to, per month?</h3>

<p>January: 193<br />
February: 112<br />
March: 85<br />
April: 96<br />
May: 72<br />
June: 125<br />
July: 76<br />
August: 69<br />
September: 169<br />
October: 106<br />
November: 79<br />
December: 131</p>

<p>This is another category which I like but against which I can&rsquo;t draw many conclusions. Who knows what can explain July&rsquo;s relative lack of diversity. Perhaps I was too distracted by the spike in work that comes yearly during this time.</p>

<h3 id="what-album-did-we-listen-to-the-most">What album did we listen to the most?</h3>

<p>Minecraft - Volume Beta (108 tracks)</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t recommend C418 enough for the programmers out there reading this. He&rsquo;s
a phenomenal artist, and he will help you get in the zone. His tracks have just enough tempo to keep your head bobbing but not enough to create a distraction. I find it completely conducive to deep thinking, so you can imagine why the listen-count is so high.</p>

<h3 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h3>

<p>It was a great year of music. I think we used Spotify and Soma.fm to the
fullest. I&rsquo;m happy with what I listened to, and I can only
look forward to what 2015 brings to my ears!</p>
