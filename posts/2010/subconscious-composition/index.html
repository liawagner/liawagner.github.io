        <h2>Subconscious Composition</h2>
        <p class="post-date">May 11, 2010</p>

        <p>The next time you are walking around and something catches your eye, stop and think about <em><strong>exactly</strong></em> what it was that caused you to stop. It may not be immediately apparent to your conscious mind, but your subconscious knows what it&rsquo;s doing. Trust it! Give yourself some time to absorb the scene and you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with a better picture. It may not come to you immediately, but with practice you&rsquo;ll begin to be able to identify the key points in a scene that initially drew your eye to it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of what I&rsquo;m talking about. Today I went to my local <a href="http://www.dama-ncr.org/">DAMA</a> meeting, which was held out in D.C. near Union Station. As soon as I got off of the escalator and outside into the weather (cold and dreary), I was greeted with beautiful light, arches, and patterns:</p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 648px"><a href="/uploads/2010/05/DC_01.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-161  " title="Initial scene outside of Union Station" src="/uploads/2010/05/DC_01.jpg" alt="Initial scene outside of Union Station" width="648" height="486" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Initial scene outside of Union Station</p></div>

<p>Taking this scene in for a bit, what really drew my eye wasn&rsquo;t the brick patterns. It wasn&rsquo;t really the light in any particular spot either - it was a drab day and the light was diffused everywhere. Focusing on those things as the collective subject creates a rather uninspiring image that looks like it could have been taken anywhere D.C.:
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="/uploads/2010/05/DC_06.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-165 " title="Patterns and light on a drab day" src="/uploads/2010/05/DC_06.jpg" alt="Patterns and light on a drab day" width="630" height="472" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Patterns and light on a drab day</p></div>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thinking a bit more, the real pattern popped out to me. What was catching my eye was the progression of archways into an almost-vanishing point far down the walkway. Tightening up my composition to just include those elements makes the picture much more compelling:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="/uploads/2010/05/DC_02.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-167 " title="Light at the end of the tunnel" src="/uploads/2010/05/DC_02.jpg" alt="Light at the end of the tunnel" width="630" height="472" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Light at the end of the tunnel</p></div>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&rsquo;s another example from later in the day. After my meeting finished up, I headed down to the <a href="http://www.npg.si.edu/">National Portrait Gallery</a> near the Verizon Center. The interior of the building is like a hollowed-out box, with the middle being an enclosed courtyard where you can hang out or get a bite to eat. I loved the look of the courtyard - especially its unique roof:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="/uploads/2010/05/DC_05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-169 " title="Kogod Courtyard" src="/uploads/2010/05/DC_05.jpg" alt="Kogod Courtyard" width="630" height="472" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kogod Courtyard</p></div>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That roof is really nice, but what drew my eye to it was that curve in the far distance. It is mesmerizing! I zoomed my camera in to get a better view of just that peculiar angle, which resulted in this:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 472px"><a href="/uploads/2010/05/DC_04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-171 " title="That interesting curved roof" src="/uploads/2010/05/DC_04.jpg" alt="That interesting curved roof" width="472" height="630" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That interesting curved roof</p></div>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By sitting back and taking in the scene, I was able to grab a couple of good ones today. Oh, and I got to say hello to John Brown in the process - look at that gnarly beard!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="/uploads/2010/05/DC_07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-173 " title="John Brown and his beard" src="/uploads/2010/05/DC_07.jpg" alt="John Brown and his beard" width="630" height="472" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">John Brown and his beard</p></div>
