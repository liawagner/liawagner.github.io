        <h2>Mindful Running Hacks</h2>
        <p class="post-date">July 1, 2010</p>

<p>I love running; I&rsquo;m a runner. On weekends, early in the morning, and even during my ever-decreasing lunch breaks, I run. I feel like it gives me the clairvoyance needed to tackle whatever problems I&rsquo;m having in my life at the moment. As an example, right now I mostly focus on how to solve programming problems by putting them on the back-burner of my mind while my feet hit the pavement repeatedly. It&rsquo;s therapeutic! It&rsquo;s also a huge benefit to your body, but I don&rsquo;t have to tell you that, right? There are a few problems that I have to consider when running, though. Long distance running can be a mind game in which winning means enjoying your run and losing means experiencing pure agony for each centimeter traveled. This post is about handling that mind game.</p>

<p>Let me start by saying that long distance running is completely relative to each person and their experience. I&rsquo;m sure &ldquo;long run&rdquo; to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Salazar">Alberto Salazaar</a> means 20+ miles in a single stretch. It can be relative on other things, too - 5 mile runs seem much longer when you are running in 90 degree, 80% humidity weather, don&rsquo;t they! For purposes of this post my &ldquo;long&rdquo; runs are those of 5 miles or longer only because that seems to be a sweet spot.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing: when I&rsquo;m running long distances, I tend to psych myself out when I think too much about how my body is performing. I get into an endless loop of assessment similar to the following:
<ul>
    <li>How is my breathing - is it too rapid, too conversational?</li>
    <li>How is the &ldquo;chaffage&rdquo; situation - are my armpits, legs, etc uncomfortable?</li>
    <li>Am I getting enough water, carbs?</li>
    <li>How am I doing on my target pace?</li>
</ul>
While certainly useful in a long race, this constant checking and re-checking makes me <strong>too aware</strong> of any degradations in my performance. Translation: by constantly assessing myself, I find that I actually decrease my performance. Not good! To remedy this self-imposed issue, I employ one or more of the following &ldquo;mindful running hacks&rdquo; to keep my mind in check and to get more enjoyment out of my runs. I call them mind<em><strong>ful</strong></em> because they don&rsquo;t really involve your physical self; these things deal exclusively with the battles you can have inside your mind when running long distances. Anyway, here goes&hellip;
<ol>
    <li>
<h3><strong>Establish a mantra</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
A mantra is something - a phrase, song, word - that you repeat over and over either physically or mentally to occupy your mind&rsquo;s conscious thoughts; it&rsquo;s really just a big distraction, not at all unlike when you think about your summer vacation (or other happy times) when you are in the dentist&rsquo;s chair. I use mantras to zone out when running. I tend to go with some sort of positive or realistic phrase pertinent to my route. Examples:
<ul>
    <li>This is how I&rsquo;m <em>supposed </em>to feel</li>
    <li>&lt;insert some lyrics of a song I&rsquo;ve been listening to here&gt;</li>
    <li>Calm, cool, collected, <em>confident</em></li>
    <li>X (substitute X with whatever mile/km you are currently on)</li>
</ul>
I find they are effective as such, but relatively boring overall. This means that the longer my run is, the less likely I am to utilize this one. I have to break up the monotony, which leads me to my next point.
<h3><strong>2. Break up the run into chunks</strong></h3>
I break down my long runs into manageable chunks, and I only focusing on one chunk at a time. In the middle of my 10 mile run, I think about the plethora of other 5 mile runs I&rsquo;ve completed with no problem. I will myself to forget the miles that are increasingly behind me - what&rsquo;s left is what matters, and what&rsquo;s left is shrinking with each step! I find that I break down my runs into roughly half-mile increments. That&rsquo;s probably a byproduct of my watch&rsquo;s capacity to store lap information, but you can use whatever works for you.
<h3><strong>3. Positive thinking, visualization</strong></h3>
I know, it sounds lame. But if it is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cant-Accept-Not-Trying-Excellence/dp/0062511904/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1278002864&amp;sr=8-3">good enough for Michael Jordan</a>, why shouldn&rsquo;t it be good enough for me? I envision my run before and during my actual run. This helps me anticipate how I am going to physically feel as I take step after step. Knowing what to expect mid-race makes me feel more in control, thus boosting my confidence. What I do is think mostly about how my body is going to handle the most difficult portions of a given route - that big up/downhill, the slippery rock or dirt section, etc.  - then I play that section in my head over and over. With repetition comes boredom, so when I actually encounter the obstacle I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it doesn&rsquo;t seem so bad.
<h3><strong>4. Use Jeff Galloway&rsquo;s &ldquo;dirty tricks&rdquo;</strong></h3>
I have a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marathon-You-Can-Jeff-Galloway/dp/0936070250">&ldquo;Marathon: You Can Do It!&rdquo; by Jeff Galloway</a>, the running guru. In it he provides a couple of mind techniques to use that he calls &ldquo;dirty tricks.&rdquo; All of them are more or less distraction techniques, but I want to bear mention of them here. I&rsquo;ve tried each with success, although with a slight bit of embarrassment. The good thing is that no one has to know - it&rsquo;s all in your head!:
<ul>
    <li>Pretend that you and the person in front of you are lashed together with a giant rubber band. Envision the tension of that rubber band is propelling your body forward and past your opponent.</li>
    <li>In an effort to decrease the influence of the right brain when running (which seems to be the dominant half when doing so, for some reason), do math or other analytical (non-logic) problems that help engage your left brain. The idea is to shift the balance between your left and right brains to keep your mind fresh.</li>
    <li>Imagine a giant hand is guiding you through the difficult parts of the race, gently pushing you so as to relieve part of your strain.</li>
    <li>Glide vs. Stride - switch up your stride every once in a while. Go from short, choppy strides to long ones where your feet barely clear the ground. Note: this one isn&rsquo;t just a mental trick. The physical changes help your muscles go longer.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5. Get Angry</strong></h3>
When I really can&rsquo;t get myself into gear, I imagine things that make me angry. I envision all of my friends laughing at my speed (or lack thereof) or I replay an embarrassing incident in my life. When I do this I feel the immediate need to improve; to prove that those incidents are behind me and I am now a better person. Really though, I tend to use this as a last resort because it is negative thinking.
<h3><strong>In conclusion&hellip;</strong></h3>
So there you have it - my list of things I use to make my runs less mind-numbingly difficult. I find that if I use the things I&rsquo;ve mentioned here my long runs (those of 5 or more miles, but your YMMV) become enjoyable because I&rsquo;m not endlessly diagnosing myself and my performance. Rather, I&rsquo;m focusing on generally positive thoughts or distracting myself altogether. Either way I see a net benefit in becoming more fit and enjoying it all the while!</p>
