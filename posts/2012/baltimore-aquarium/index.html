        <h2>Baltimore Aquarium</h2>
        <p class="post-date">March 4, 2012</p>

        <p>Yesterday we went to the Baltimore Aquarium with my parents. What a
fantastic trip! We started off the day at about 7AM, packing everyone
into the Ford at 8AM and scooting off as fast as we could towards I-95. The
Aquarium has a slot-based approach to tickets, and each slot lasts for
about 30 minutes. Our slot was for 9:30, which meant we had just over an
hour to get there from Sterling. Given the rush we stopped at Dunkin
Donuts - a guilty pleasure - for some flatbread and sugary coffee.</p>

<p>We arrived just in time and went inside, where Layla was super excited
to see all the fish in their front-lobby tank. It reminded me of what
the Bass Pro Shops in Hampton has in their store, with all of the
natural habitat replicated to fit a modern interior. Past this area you
come to a wide-open area where they have some sharks and stingrays in a
giant ground floor tank. Layla was wide-eyed and mesmorized, repeating
all of the words we told her in her best drone voice: &ldquo;ray,&rdquo; &ldquo;shark&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Making our way up the escalators (which were awesome, given the building
is rather small horizontally but huge vertically) we saw her favorite
thing of the day: a huge green sea turtle we hadn&rsquo;t seen down below. It
cruised around the area with only one front fin, which told us it was
probably a rescue. They began to feed it lettuce and Layla told us the
play by play! She even said &ldquo;turtle eating leaf,&rdquo; which made our jaws
drop. On this second floor we also saw a &ldquo;Nemo&rdquo; fish (clownfish), a Nautilus,
and an octopus.</p>

<p>Going up a floor we went into the rainforest area, which was super humid
for what we were wearing. We didn&rsquo;t see too many animals there,
which was a bit disappointing. The one bird we did see had a
piercing &ldquo;fox call&rdquo; that made us want to leave immediately. We did see an orange monkey and a sloth
way up in the treetop, though. We moved on pretty quickly because we
were so uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Once you reach the top of the building, you start making your way down
through other various tanks and exhibits. I really enjoyed seeing the
sand tiger sharks during that part. They&rsquo;d slowly glide by, showing off
their teeth like they were proud of them. Kristin was weirded out by one
of the sharks that looked like it was staring her down.</p>

<p>Lunch time came about and we went out to the Hard Rock Cafe. All the
memorabilia there is so awesome - Eddie Vedder&rsquo;s guitar case, Elvis&rsquo;
robe and grammy nomination letter, Keith Richards&rsquo; guitar, and many more
things. Even though we had to wait for about 45 minutes for lunch to
arrive, the food was great. Plus, they have LCDs everywhere playing
music videos, so I was at least entertained. Layla was dead tired by
this time, though, and she fell asleep in Pa&rsquo;s lap until the food
arrived.</p>

<p>We went home and Nanny&rsquo;s job was to keep Layla awake for the car ride. The
technique worked and we were all rewarded with a much-needed nap! It was
a good capstone to a day well spent.</p>
