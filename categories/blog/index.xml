      <description>&lt;p&gt;Corolla is a good spot to visit if you&amp;rsquo;re in the OBX area. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of great food and ample things to see. Kristin and I visited on our third day. Unfortunately we went smack-dab in the middle of the day, so the whole town was crowded with tourists. We still enjoyed the sites around &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.currituckbeachlight.com/&#34; title=&#34;The lighthouse&#34;&gt;Currituck Beach Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; and the nearby &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visitwhalehead.com/&#34; title=&#34;The Whalehead Club&#34;&gt;Whalehead Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is less than $10 to climb the lighthouse, by the time we arrived the line was tremendous. It looked like over an hour wait, so we simply enjoyed the site of it from the exterior. Maybe my legs silently thanked me for not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/8/Corolla/l/Corolla_004_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Currituck Beach Lighthouse&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;Currituck Beach Lighthouse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearby there is a fishing/crabbing pier that offers a view back to the lighthouse through the thick, non-native foliage (we read something about a particular plant taking over the area). You can look out over the sound from some extremely shallow water, where the birds love searching for their dinners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose someone offers flying tours of the area. That would be pretty amazing! This plane essentially buzzed the tower of the lighthouse:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kitty Hawk</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2013/kitty-hawk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just arrived home from a wonderful vacation in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Kristin and I treated ourselves to an oceanfront room right at the entryway to the outer banks. We did what we intended - explored the local places to eat and hung out on the beach. Nothing more, nothing less! The weather cooperated for the most part, and I was able to try about five different coffee places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was certainly fantastic to wake up to this view every morning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/8/Corolla/l/Corolla_001_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Morning view from the top floor of the Hilton&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;Morning view from the top floor of the Hilton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/8/Corolla/l/Corolla_002_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;The sun rises over Kitty Hawk, NC&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&#34;The sun rises over Kitty Hawk, NC&#34; title=&#34;The sun rises over Kitty Hawk, NC&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/8/Corolla/m/Corolla_002_m.jpg&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;The sun rises over Kitty Hawk, NC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the dining highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://duckdonuts.com/&#34; title=&#34;The best donuts ever&#34;&gt;Duck Donuts&lt;/a&gt; - The best donuts ever. Made to order and piping hot. I recommend the maple. The coffee wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything to call home about, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.waveriderscoffeeanddeli.com/&#34; title=&#34;Waverider&#39;s Coffee and Deli&#34;&gt;Waveriders Coffee&lt;/a&gt; - Now this is a place to call home about. The coffee here was the best I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a long time. By the smell of the place, they roast it there. This is opposed to a bunch of other places that buy beans from Kill Devil Coffee. They make a pretty mean egg bagel sandwich as well. Best of all, they have comfy couches upon which to rest your sandy butt after an early morning photography session!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blackpelican.com/cms/&#34; title=&#34;The Black Pelican&#34;&gt;The Black Pelican&lt;/a&gt; - Hands down my favorite seafood restaurant in the area. It&amp;rsquo;s always hopping, even at 6PM. It is worth the wait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.obbrewing.com/&#34; title=&#34;Outer Banks Brewing Station&#34;&gt;Outer Banks Brewing Station&lt;/a&gt; - Beer aficionados look no further. This is a micro-brewery featuring some award winning (read: tasty) beers. As a bonus the entire place runs off of wind turbine located in the back of the premises. I had the &amp;ldquo;Nitwit&amp;rdquo; witbier and enjoyed every drop. This place fills up quickly, but fortunately the bar is full service and has a quick turnover rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.obxtacobar.com/&#34; title=&#34;Outer Banks Taco Bar&#34;&gt;Outer Banks Taco Bar&lt;/a&gt; - Unassuming and small, this place still packs a punch if you&amp;rsquo;re into Mexican food. The fish tacos were amazing, and the queso had some kick!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things I will do differently next time. For one, I will make sure to bring my quality pair of sunglasses. Mere minutes from the house I noted that I had left my glasses behind, yet I did not turn around - mistaaaaaake! The cheap sunglasses I bought at the surf shop hurt my head and didn&amp;rsquo;t cut the sun out very well. They at least allowed me to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mistake would be bringing spray-based sunblock. The spray stuff from Wegmans stung our eyes and did not fend off the sun as well as a cream. In other words, the convenience of the spray was entirely nullified by its lack of effectiveness. Cream costs less, lasts longer, and does what it is supposed to do (you know, &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; the sun).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I should really consider bringing special shoes to run on the beach. I ran on the beach twice during the trip and I had pain on both occasions. Some sand booties would help there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I am very impressed with the selection of stuff to do there. Although I have visited the place frequently since I was young, OBX continues to surprise me with its variety of shops and sights. I will have to set aside a bit more time in the future for more exploration of the southern end. This trip I was entirely focused on relaxation, so I am okay with leaving more than a few things undone. See you next year, OBX!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Four State Challenge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AT Memorial Day Weekend 2013 – The Four State Challenge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After five years of hiking and camping on the Appalachian Trail for Memorial Day, for 2013 the group decided to try something a bit different: a long-distance single day hike. Since I live so close to Harper&amp;rsquo;s Ferry, WV, the so-called “four state challenge” was a perfect fit for us. The challenge is to hike the 42 miles from the Pennsylvania-Maryland border to the West Virginia-Virginia border in under 24 hours. This is normally done with a ground support team to provide food and water to the hikers at the road crossings, so we secured some (gracious) help from our friend Jeremy P. Everything was set to kick off early on Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the trip began with a little frustration for me. With under twelve hours to go before our start and after having cleaned my house and car in preparation, I received a phone call from Phil that the group wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to stay at my house after all. They were instead heading straight up to Harper&amp;rsquo;s Ferry to take advantage of camping for at least one night. In retrospect I can&amp;rsquo;t fault them for that, but I would have liked a bit more notice ahead of time. The change left me stressed out and jittery in my house. I&amp;rsquo;m sure Kristin got sick of my pacing! Knowing I had a solitary drive to Harper&amp;rsquo;s Ferry ahead of me, I grabbed as much sleep as possible shortly after receiving the call. I hit my bed at about 10 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up not-so-bright and early at 1:30 AM and made myself a delicious pour-over coffee using hand ground Wegman&amp;rsquo;s beans (which I highly recommend for a mega-jolt of caffeine early in the morning). I set out for Harper&amp;rsquo;s Ferry just after 2 AM, hoping to hit my target of a 3 AM meet up. I made great time in the pitch blackness, having only the occasional deer for company. I&amp;rsquo;d honk at them to force them to scatter, also hoping that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wake up anyone around the area. I arrived at Weverton just after 3 AM and stepped out into a near-40 degree morning. It was immediately apparent that my short sleeve dry-fit shirt wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to cut it. I put on a thicker shirt and hopped back in the car, and with a couple of short honks of the horn brought out my groggy hiking mates. They had been staying on some flat ground just off the parking lot. We quickly loaded up the car and made way for Pen Mar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to Pen Mar in the pre-dawn darkness, striking off on the trail at 4:30 after a brief goodbye to our trusty driver. Most of us had our headlamps on full blast, which led to some interesting creature sightings if we glanced to our left or right. We stopped only to take a quick look at the moon over the High Rock area before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 655px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/l/2013-05-25 05.41.51_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;The moon over High Rock&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&#34;650&#34; height=&#34;488&#34; alt=&#34;The moon over High Rock&#34; title=&#34;The moon over High Rock&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/m/2013-05-25 05.41.51_m.jpg&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;The moon over High Rock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;rsquo;d soon come to find out, Maryland is chock full of sizeable rocks that are more than willing to roll your ankle or batter the soles of your feet. As a testament to the evilness of the rocks, Jeremy M. rolled his ankle several times during the initial 6 miles and was suffering from some back pain as a result. When we met up with Jeremy P. at Raven Rock Hollow after 5 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; miles he decided to become our navigator. We&amp;rsquo;d been whittled down to three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy, Phil, and I started the next section as the sun finished making its way up. Phil and I alternated between being cold and sweating, depending on the incline and whether or not our outer layers were on. Each of us hadn&amp;rsquo;t expected it to remain so chilly throughout the mid-morning (it stayed in the low 60s for most of the day, with a strong breeze). We chatted briefly with a few other hikers heading the other way and generally kept up a cheerful spirit. After a decent amount of tedium we came upon an open field which raised our spirits even more. There&amp;rsquo;s just something to be said about such a sight at 8 in the morning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 655px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;It&#39;s turning out to be a beautiful morning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 655px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/l/2013-05-25 07.48.17_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;A nice field&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;A nice field&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 493px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;It is good to be back on the trail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An old, rusted-out bike that someone had left out for no particular reason also sparked our interest along the way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 493px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/l/2013-05-25 07.58.52_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Rusted bike&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&#34;488&#34; height=&#34;650&#34; alt=&#34;Rusted bike&#34; title=&#34;Rusted bike&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/m/2013-05-25 07.58.52_m.jpg&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;Rusted bike&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our 5 mile section went by quickly, and before we knew it we were reunited with our driver and navigator at Wolfsville Road. We&amp;rsquo;d done 10 out of the 42 miles. We munched on some protein bars and gatorade, made some grocery requests, and chatted with some other folks doing the same trip before heading onto the next section: a bruising 9 miles to the I-70 footbridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next section started off with a side trail, which we traveled on for about a half mile before deciding to strike off into the raw wilderness to find the AT. Using Tommy&amp;rsquo;s GPS, we climbed through ragged terrain and fallen trees to eventually land back on track with little time lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 493px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/l/2013-05-25 10.05.04_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;The eye of the beholder!&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&#34;488&#34; height=&#34;650&#34; alt=&#34;The eye of the beholder!&#34; title=&#34;The eye of the beholder!&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/m/2013-05-25 10.05.04_m.jpg&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;The eye of the beholder!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The miles began to wear on us as we worked our way through the section. Though nothing too serious yet, each of us had our own aches and pains to deal with. The incline from Smithsburg, MD up into the woods was brutal, adding additional fatigue to already-tired muscles. We passed the time by picking categories and trying to find a item in the category starting with each letter of the alphabet. We started with movies (easy) and finished with television shows (hard) before retreating back into our minds for a bit. We broke out of the funk by taking a much-needed break at Black Rock Cliffs a little after 10:20 AM:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;Black Rock Cliffs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;Pano of Black Rock Cliffs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing on our section, each of us experienced increasingly painful muscles. Phil&amp;rsquo;s IT band was acting up by this point, and Tommy&amp;rsquo;s calves were burning. The soles of my feet were battered and bruised and starting to swell. Wishing not to waste any time, we hurried along the trail towards our next rendezvous point at the footbridge. At least we had good scenery along the way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 493px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;Some sort of fungi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 493px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/l/2013-05-25 10.40.16_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the footbridge at exactly noon to meet the Jeremys. They had gotten us some treats from the grocery store, and to say we enjoyed them greatly would be an understatement. We dominated that food like we were breaking a four-day fast. That poor bag of popcorn never had a chance, much less the bag of snickers minis! For 15 minutes we were in heaven sitting by the side of the road on a gorgeous day, not minding our aching legs and feet. We&amp;rsquo;d traveled 18 out of the 42 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 493px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;The I-70 footbridge is being overtaken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been through the area before with Tommy, I had suggested earlier that we break for lunch at the Washington Monument, three miles further down the trail. We hitched up our water packs, stuffed some sunflower seeds in our pockets, then hit the trail with that in mind. It was about this time that we encountered a group of boisterous senior citizens outright flying down the trail behind us. As we stepped aside to let them by, we determined that they were doing the exact same trip as us. We were floored. Here we were - three reasonably young guys in pretty damn good shape – getting destroyed by retirees. We certainly picked up our pace after that encounter, but we also paid the price of that speed with currency of pain. By the time we saw the monument looming in the near distance we were exhausted, and just about collapsed on its front knoll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 655px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;View from the front of the Washington Monument&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 493px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/l/2013-05-25 13.11.10_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;The monument itself&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&#34;488&#34; height=&#34;650&#34; alt=&#34;The monument itself&#34; title=&#34;The monument itself&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/m/2013-05-25 13.11.10_m.jpg&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;The monument itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ate our food at the top of the monument and attempted to prepare ourselves for the next section, which would be from Monument Road to Crampton Gap in Gathland State Park. Phil caught some sleep in the spare 7 minutes he had at the top while Tommy and I sat incapacitated on the floor. We went down the spiral staircase of the monument, stopped quickly at the car for another gatorade, then hit the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point all of us were in pretty bad shape physically. While it wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprising that we were sore, what was surprising was how acute the pain was becoming. Phil&amp;rsquo;s IT band starting giving him major trouble on one of the big uphills, and I quickly came to realize that the soles of my feet were turning into swollen balls of agony. The more I walked, the more they screamed at me. Their domination of my mind was complete, so I could no longer ignore them. Tommy wasn&amp;rsquo;t immune either – he was having some trouble with the downhills and was getting more and more quiet as the time went by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was around this time that I started worrying that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to make it. We had a hard 9 miles to go before seeing the Jeremys and I was deteriorating at an alarming rate. I slogged through those miles in every way that I could, from cursing the rocks to talking about our upcoming (fatty) dinner. In the end I made it to Gathland, but the moment I arrived at the car and sat down I knew I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to get back up again. I&amp;rsquo;d gone 33 out of the 42 miles and I was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 493px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/l/2013-05-25 14.20.14_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Heading down from the mountain&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&#34;488&#34; height=&#34;650&#34; alt=&#34;Heading down from the mountain&#34; title=&#34;Heading down from the mountain&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/6/4SC/m/2013-05-25 14.20.14_m.jpg&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;Heading down from the mountain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for me, Phil wasn&amp;rsquo;t moving either. He soon came to the same conclusion about his legs. He took some Tylenol and collapsed on the curb, asleep in what seemed like seconds. Tommy thought about it for a bit, then decided to stay back as well. I can&amp;rsquo;t blame him – a solitary three miles in the woods when you&amp;rsquo;re already feeling like crap doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly sound like fun, even if you&amp;rsquo;re physically able to complete the mileage. We all considered 33 miles formidable for a first attempt. It was, after all, the furthest we&amp;rsquo;d ever hiked in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing the carnage in the parking lot, a kind woman offered us some fresh watermelon slices. They were divine! After talking with her for a bit we found out her husband was in the group of retirees who passed us earlier. She told us to not let them get us down because every one of them do the four-state challenge every year. She also mentioned that most of them were ultramarathoners (one even had done the Badwater ultra). I guess we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been so discouraged after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After going back to Weverton to pick up the other cars, we all gathered back in Sterling for a wonderfully decadent dinner at Sweetwater. Greasy burgers, fries, and several micro-brews capped off a day that I won&amp;rsquo;t soon forget. After dinner the Jeremys went back to Fredericksburg and Tommy, Phil, and I went back to my place for some much needed rest. I gave Kristin and Layla (who was still up at 9) a kiss goodnight, set up the guys with bedding, then hit my bed like a sack of potatoes. My four state challenge was over.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Quick Camping Trip on Weverton Cliff</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Summertime is upon us, and the time was right for Tommy and I to do our annual tune-up hike in preparation for the bigger Memorial Day one. This time around we chose to head up north of Harper’s Ferry, WV to a shelter we’d passed by a few years ago: the Ed Garvey Shelter on the Appalachian Trail. The one-way distance was just a little over 6 miles and the elevation gain moderate. Paired with the perfect weather - mid 60s during the day, upper 40s during the night - the scene was set for a great time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off by dropping the dog off at a friend’s place in Chantilly, then went straight up Rt. 15 to Harper’s Ferry. After fumbling around looking for a parking spot for a few minutes, we lucked out and nabbed a free spot right near the park. We waved goodbye to my Corolla and started across the bridge to Maryland around noon. We trod along the smooth, flat C&amp;amp;O towpath for three miles, noting the tons of turtles out on their respective logs to our left. To our right the Potomac flowed rapidly off the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We crossed over the railroad and began our ascent, bringing forth the first sweat of the day. Fortunately the breeze was abundant and overall the hike was really pleasant. The rocks underfoot were the only annoyance, forcing us to keep a keen eye downwards instead of on our surroundings. We were also a bit disappointed with the huge amount of noise pollution coming from the semis and Harleys whizzing by on Rt 340 nearby. We shrugged it off with jokes from South Park about Harley owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little over two miles of hiking up the mountain we came to our first side trail to Weverton Cliff. We were impressed with the site, which offers commanding views of the entire area. We hung out there for over an hour, taking pictures and chatting with some folks up there for the day. As always for Tommy and I, the hike wouldn’t have been complete without running into a Boy Scout troop somewhere along the line. We found ours hanging out at the cliff with all sorts of heavy equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;Weverton Cliff, midday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having downed a protein bar for lunch, we made our way further north to the Ed Garvey Shelter. It was just as we remembered it - impressive. It sports two stories and an upper “apartment” area, both of which are pretty rare as AT shelters go. Already there were two guys out for the weekend with their dog Oreo, who had a large bell attached to his collar. We decided to take a breather by bundling up in our sleeping bags for a snooze in the lower area. When we awoke the guys and their dog were gone, and we decided to double back to Weverton Cliff to spend the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Weverton at about 6:30, where we promptly cooked our couscous with olive oil. This was a huge improvement over previous attempts without the oil, so that’s something I’ll have to continue in the future - it was delicious. With each of us full, we waited for the sunset and grabbed our sleeping bags from our camp about 100 feet behind us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun dipped below the horizon slowly, and we watched people come and go to see the sight. I grabbed as many panoramas as I could of the scene, hoping to catch a good one. Soon the time came for us both to head into our hammocks for some sleep. We each had fitful nights for different reasons. Tommy was cold because he forgot his sleeping pad, and I was shifting from my left side to my right because of my allergies bothering my nose. Par for the course in sleeping in the woods, I suppose. I think both of us tallied about 6 hours of sleep, so not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke at about seven in the morning and went straight down the mountain with little fanfare. The going was quick and the breeze was stiff, but the sights kept us going. We also discussed plans of doing a four-state challenge (41 miles from the PA line to the VA line in one day) instead our normal Memorial Day hike, so we talked around all of the issues we could think of. By the time we reached the bottom we had it all figured out. We hopped back in the car and back down Rt 9 towards home, stopping at Stonybrook Farm along the way for some coffee. We arrived back at my place just before noon for a glorious showers, each having had a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2013/5/WevertonCliff/&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are the rest of the pictures I took during the trip if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Last.fm and MOC</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2011/last-fm-and-moc/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2011 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2011/last-fm-and-moc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.last.fm&#34;&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;. For those not aware, it is a music recommendation service. It does its recommendations based on your own listening patterns; it watches the tracks you play on your computer and compares it to those played by other people sharing common artists. As an example, Last.fm recommends that I check out the band Catch 22 (who I do not have in my music library) based on the number of times I&amp;rsquo;ve played songs by Less Than Jake and because other people who have listened to Less Than Jake listen to Catch 22. Pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that is critical to the entire Last.fm experience is the connection between the music player you use and the Last.fm servers that make the recommendations. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have that connection, you won&amp;rsquo;t get any recommendations! Forming the bridge between the two is something called a &lt;em&gt;scrobbler; &lt;/em&gt;the scrobbler is the piece of software that watches what you&amp;rsquo;re playing on your music player and sends that information over to the recommendation servers. Last.fm provides a scrobbler client for both Windows and Mac as a free download. Although not officially supported, Linux users can still participate with plugins for many popular players (Amarok, Rhythmbox, Audacious).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Linux music players without ready-made plugins can use the service through a software package called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.red-bean.com/decklin/lastfmsubmitd/&#34;&gt;lastfmsubmitd&lt;/a&gt;. This software package sets up a generic way for players to send data over to Last.fm via the standard client/server model familiar to most Linux users. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I set it up with MOC, a popular command-line music player.
&lt;h3&gt;Get the lastfmsubmitd package&lt;/h3&gt;
I run Ubuntu on my home theater PC, which is where I play most of my music at home. To install lastfmsubmitd there I ran the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get install lastfmsubmitd&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the installation you&amp;rsquo;ll be asked several straightforward questions (username, password), after which you&amp;rsquo;ll be left with a running lastfmsubmitd daemon. Check to make sure it is up and running with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;ps -ef | grep lastfmsubmit[d]&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see a process running under that name. If not, the following should get you up and running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/lastfmsubmitd start&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is hooking up your player to submit information to lastfmsubmitd.
&lt;h3&gt;Change your MOC configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
MOC is my music player of choice, and unfortunately it is one that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a prebuilt plugin for Last.fm. Instead I have to add the following in my ~/.moc/config file to make MOC submit the songs I play to lastfmsubmitd:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;OnSongChange = &amp;quot;/usr/lib/lastfmsubmitd/lastfmsubmit --artist %a --title %t --length %d --album %r&amp;quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this does is submit each song to lastfmsubmitd when you start playing it. lastfmsubmitd then submits the song data to the actual Last.fm servers using its own built in submission client (that&amp;rsquo;s the /usr/lib/lastfmsubmitd/lastfmsubmit part). Take note that this method sends data &lt;em&gt;right when the song changes&lt;/em&gt;. If you are a habitual song-changer and don&amp;rsquo;t feel like spamming Last.fm with songs that you really haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to fully, check out Luke Plant&amp;rsquo;s submission script &lt;a href=&#34;http://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/moc-and-last-fm/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, as it may suit you better. I rarely skip around in songs, so I just stick with the default submission client (the one in the OnSongChange config above) .
&lt;h3&gt;Restart and Verify!&lt;/h3&gt;
You have to completely restart MOC before the configuration option goes into effect. Take care to kill the process if it is still running after you&amp;rsquo;ve exited to the terminal, as MOC is a server process. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve verified that the process is gone, fire up &amp;lsquo;mocp&amp;rsquo; again and play a song or two. Check your Last.fm profile page shortly after you start the song. If you see it showing up in the list, you&amp;rsquo;re in business!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Planning ahead for MySQL partitioning</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2011/planning-ahead-for-mysql-partitioning/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2011 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2011/planning-ahead-for-mysql-partitioning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;
Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose you are modeling a database in MySQL 5.5. Based on your knowledge of the requirements for the application &lt;em&gt;behind &lt;/em&gt;this database you can guess which of the tables within it are going to be huge. For those huge tables you want to plan ahead to make sure that you can scale out your data such that you have less headaches in the future. Here&amp;rsquo;s the catch: you want to keep it simple until it comes time to scale out. That sounds like an honorable goal, right? Now how exactly do we do that&amp;hellip;hmm. This post is how I would approach this problem. I hope you can gain something from it. I certainly learned some things in trying to get this stuff to work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ground this problem scenario into something concrete let&amp;rsquo;s assume that we&amp;rsquo;re modeling a simple relationship - players and games in a multiplayer game. Here&amp;rsquo;s the model that we&amp;rsquo;re after:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 559px&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: x-small;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/normal_relationship.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-613&#34; title=&#34;Multiplayer game ER diagram&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/normal_relationship.png&#34; alt=&#34;Multiplayer game ER diagram&#34; width=&#34;559&#34; height=&#34;149&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Multiplayer game ER diagram&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the DDL to create this model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:sql;&#34;&gt;
CREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `parttest`.`player` (
`player_id` INT NOT NULL ,
`name` VARCHAR(30) NULL ,
PRIMARY KEY (`player_id`) )
ENGINE = InnoDB;

CREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `parttest`.`game` (
`game_id` INT NOT NULL ,
`duration` TIME NULL ,
`start_dt` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL ,
PRIMARY KEY (`game_id`) )
ENGINE = InnoDB;

CREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `parttest`.`player_game` (
`player_id` INT NOT NULL ,
`game_id` INT NOT NULL ,
`create_dt` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL ,
PRIMARY KEY (`player_id`, `game_id`) ,
INDEX `player_game_fk01` (`player_id` ASC) ,
INDEX `player_game_fk02` (`game_id` ASC) ,
CONSTRAINT `player_game_fk01`
FOREIGN KEY (`player_id` )
REFERENCES `parttest`.`player` (`player_id` )
ON DELETE NO ACTION
ON UPDATE NO ACTION,
CONSTRAINT `player_game_fk02`
FOREIGN KEY (`game_id` )
REFERENCES `parttest`.`game` (`game_id` )
ON DELETE NO ACTION
ON UPDATE NO ACTION)
ENGINE = InnoDB;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this model we have players and games. Many players can participate in a single game and many games can be played by a single player, thus the two tables &amp;ldquo;player&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; have a many-to-many relationship. To represent that in the database we have an associative table (&amp;ldquo;player_game&amp;rdquo;) between the two. Also included in two of the tables are columns that track when something happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of this example let&amp;rsquo;s assume that there won&amp;rsquo;t be too many players, but those limited amount of players will play the game feverishly (it&amp;rsquo;s an addictive open source game with a small community). That means that the &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; table and the associative &amp;ldquo;player&lt;em&gt;game&amp;rdquo; table will be pretty large as time goes by - those are the two tables that we&amp;rsquo;ll want to make scalable for the future. We&amp;rsquo;ll want the option to easily &lt;em&gt;partition &lt;/em&gt;them at some point down the line.
&lt;h3&gt;Enter Partitioning&lt;/h3&gt;
Wait, wait, wait. &lt;em&gt;Partitioning&lt;/em&gt;? What the heck is that for? I won&amp;rsquo;t bore you with too many details (you can find out more &amp;lt;a href=&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition&#34;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;(database)&amp;ldquo;&amp;gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/partitioning.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), so let&amp;rsquo;s just say that partitioning is a way to split up your database tables in to smaller pieces so that operations upon them can be faster (in most situations that is the goal, at least). Partitions provide the following benefits (this is some, not all):
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Maintenance - when you split up     tables into partitions you can often do maintenance on them such    that you only affect a small amount of your users at a time. Having     partitions also allows you to easily implement a pruning or     archiving strategies depending on how you split the data. If you    split up your tables based upon create timestamp, for example, you  can easily drop or move older data (the ones that aren&amp;rsquo;t queried as     often as the newer ones) via a singleo command.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Query performance - running     queries against large datasets most often causes problems. When the     data is partitioned the database can â€œautomagicallyâ€ determine  which partitions aren&amp;rsquo;t involved in queries; it can tell which  partitions aren&amp;rsquo;t involved in the WHERE clause of your SQL  statements, thus it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to scan them. That means you   traverse less data to get the information your query needs, which in    turn equals faster performance! Of course this only applies if the  WHERE clause of the queries in question can avoid partitions. If you    are grabbing everything from a table partitioning obviously won&amp;rsquo;t   help you.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Availability - partitions can be    split onto different physical media, which means your table is still    partially available even if one of those media sources goes down.   This also has impacts with respect to maintenance (see above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implemention (some hurdles to jump)&lt;/h3&gt;
Back to the example. Since we know that the &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;player_game&amp;rdquo; tables are going to be big, let&amp;rsquo;s see how to set ourselves up for easy partitioning in the future. The goal here is to get to a partitioned table with a minimum number of ALTER TABLE statements. Ideally we&amp;rsquo;d have only one ALTER TABLE - to add partitioning! Let&amp;rsquo;s project ourselves into the future to the point in time when our data is so large that we are forced to consider partitioning. Fortunately for us our tables have no data in them, which makes our tests quick and relatively painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the initial DDL, the first step would be to try the obvious: alter the table to add partitioning! Let&amp;rsquo;s give that a try:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:sql;&#34;&gt;ALTER TABLE game

PARTITION BY RANGE(unix_timestamp(start_dt)) (

PARTITION part0 VALUES LESS THAN (unix_timestamp(&#39;2011-01-01 00:00:00&#39;)),

PARTITION part1 VALUES LESS THAN (unix_timestamp(&#39;2011-01-02 00:00:00&#39;)),

PARTITION part2 VALUES LESS THAN (unix_timestamp(&#39;2011-01-03 00:00:00&#39;)),

PARTITION part3 VALUES LESS THAN (unix_timestamp(&#39;2011-01-04 00:00:00&#39;)),

PARTITION part4 VALUES LESS THAN (unix_timestamp(&#39;2011-01-05 00:00:00&#39;)));

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that failed with the following. Bummer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[code]ERROR 1217 (23000): Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails[/code]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only table in our model with foreign keys is &amp;ldquo;player_game,&amp;rdquo; so let&amp;rsquo;s remove those constraints to move forward. Let&amp;rsquo;s do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:sql;&#34;&gt;alter table player_game drop foreign key player_game_fk01;
alter table player_game drop foreign key player_game_fk02;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now try to partition again. We run the same alter as before and get the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[code]ERROR 1503 (HY000): A PRIMARY KEY must include all columns in the table&amp;rsquo;s partitioning function[/code]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argh! What in the world does this mean? Looking up this error leads us to &lt;a href=&#34;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/partitioning-limitations-partitioning-keys-unique-keys.html&#34;&gt;this entry&lt;/a&gt; in the manual which tells us why. In short: you can&amp;rsquo;t partition a table using a column that is not included in the primary key for that table. Since the &amp;ldquo;start_dt&amp;rdquo; column isn&amp;rsquo;t in our primary key, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t proceed with our alter. Okay, so let&amp;rsquo;s add it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:sql;&#34;&gt;ALTER TABLE game DROP PRIMARY KEY;

ALTER TABLE game ADD PRIMARY KEY (game_id, start_dt);&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once more with the alter to partition, as before. Cross your fingers&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[code]Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)[/code]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success! Now all we need to do is the same ALTERs to the player_game table (using the same process we just did) and add back those foreign keys that we dropped earlier. We&amp;rsquo;ll then have our model looking like before but with the added benefit of 5 partitions each for game and player_game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:sql;&#34;&gt;ALTER TABLE player_game ADD CONSTRAINT player_game_fk01 FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES game (game_id);

ERROR 1005 (HY000): Can&#39;t create table &#39;parttest.#sql-52b_3e&#39; (errno: 150)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again - argh! What is wrong now? Going back to the limitations link from the last error gives us the answer: partitioned tables can&amp;rsquo;t have foreign keys. Yep, you heard me correctly - &lt;strong&gt;partitioned tables can&amp;rsquo;t be involved in any foreign keys. &lt;/strong&gt;Really, who needs referential integrity anyway? Just kidding, as this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;big &lt;/em&gt;limitation in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing as we&amp;rsquo;ve already dropped the foreign keys of the player_game table to get to this point, we don&amp;rsquo;t have anything further to do. To get where we are we had to remove the foreign keys from the tables that we&amp;rsquo;d be partitioning, and we had to move the column we were partitioning on into the primary key.
&lt;h3&gt;My recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
What does all this mean in terms of how to design your tables now, when they aren&amp;rsquo;t in a partitioned state? Here&amp;rsquo;s my recommendations based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen with partitioning thus far:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Build the column you will   be partitioning on in to    the primary key from the get-go. Make   sure the ordering of the primary key (if you will have multiple     columns at all) makes sense for your query load on the table. Put   the columns most used in WHERE clauses first.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;As an alternative to the    above you can keep your primary key the same but add    a unique key including all the columns of the primary key plus the  column you&amp;rsquo;ll partition on. This will help you avoid duplicate  entries when you want to bring the partitioning column into the     primary key, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have a few additional steps later (dropping     and recreate the primary key).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Keep the foreign keys in    the database in place as    long as you can while it is still available, but plan ahead in the  application by coding as if they weren&amp;rsquo;t there.     When the time comes to  partition you can then be confident that all the data up to that    point is clean in terms of its referential integrity. You&amp;rsquo;ll also   have debugged your application to flush out the errors by that time     (hopefully).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
So those are my recommendations for dealing with MySQL 5.5&amp;rsquo;s partitioning. Obviously I think they can do a lot better with their implementation. Ideally I&amp;rsquo;d like to have the ability to alter the table and add the partitions regardless of its referential integrity or primary keys. The fact that I have to sacrifice the integrity of the database tables (one of the key strong points of having a relational database in the first place) makes me very hesitant to use it at all.
&lt;h3&gt;Some Caveats&lt;/h3&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m an Oracle DBA, so take this advice with a grain of salt. The stuff in this post is just one solution to the &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo; problem. Furthermore this is just how I would handle a partitioning situation given the example provided. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear some people with more experience chime in on what they do in similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2011/backing-up-the-acer-revo-3700/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I told you about my Acer Aspire Revo 3700 - awesome things come in small packages! Unfortunately, as great as the overall package is the default operating system included was Windows 7. That&amp;rsquo;s a definite no-go, as I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of anything coming out of Microsoft. Obviously that had to go! Being the practical person I am, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to blow the Windows software &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; away. I wanted to keep a backup copy &amp;ldquo;just in case.&amp;rdquo; What case, you ask? &lt;em&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really know, but I like to keep my options open anyway. &lt;/em&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I&amp;rsquo;d just fire up my handy copy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page&#34;&gt;SystemRescueCD&lt;/a&gt; to do the backup, but the Revo 3700 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a CD drive. Bummer. I&amp;rsquo;d have to boot from a USB image instead. On first glance SystemRescueCD&amp;rsquo;s USB disk creation process seemed like too much work, so I looked for another Linux distribution that might work better. After a small bit of research I ended up settling on &lt;a href=&#34;http://grml.org/&#34;&gt;grml&lt;/a&gt;, which is a Debian-based distribution intended for textmode-savvy users. I followed the instructions I found on their &lt;a href=&#34;http://grml.org/download/&#34;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; page to install the disk image onto my 2GB USB drive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;dd if=grml_2010.12.iso of=/dev/sdb&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful with that &amp;ldquo;of=&amp;rdquo; line if you do this - your USB &lt;em&gt;might not be /dev/sdb&lt;/em&gt;! I only have one hard disk on my laptop, so my thumb drives always show up as /dev/sdb when I plug them in. You can verify which letter your thumb drive is by running &amp;ldquo;dmesg&amp;rdquo; in your terminal just after you insert the drive. You should see something like this, the bottom of which will tell you the drive identifier of your USB:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to the backup process. After my dd command finished, I popped my newly-created disk into my Revo. I hit f12 during boot to tell it to boot from USB and I was quickly in business. Speaking of business, my first order was to mount the device on which I would store the backup itself. In my case I was using a USB external hard drive that I mounted with the following command (using the same &amp;ldquo;dmesg&amp;rdquo; trick I mentioned above):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;mount /dev/sdb1 /media/backup&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next task was to back up my partition table. In the event that I had to restore what I was about to back up I would need to know how it was physically laid out. I ran the following to save that sweet, sweet partition table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;ï»¿ï»¿sfdisk -d /dev/sda &amp;gt; /media/backup/revo_parttable.bak&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next step was to mount the media needing to be backed up. There were three partitions on the stock Revo image, so I created a mount directory for each partition. Keeping things simple I just named these directories after the partitions themselves (being the simple man I am):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;for i in 1 2 3
do
mkdir -p /media/sda${i}
mount /dev/sda${i} /media/sda${i}
done&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having those partitions mounted, next up was backing up the actual data. For this task I used my favorite backup utility DAR (For Disk ARchive). DAR is awesome - really, it deserves its own post (which I am now writing down on my TODO list)! For now, though, I&amp;rsquo;ll just list the commands I used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;dar  -R /media/sda1 --gzip 1 -s 2G -c /media/backup/revo_sda1_201001
dar  -R /media/sda2 --gzip 1 -s 2G -c /media/backup/revo_sda2_201001
dar  -R /media/sda3 --gzip 1 -s 2G -c /media/backup/revo_sda3_201001&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, okay. I&amp;rsquo;ll at least give you a breakdown of those command line switches even if I can&amp;rsquo;t get to talking about DAR in depth (who knows if I will, right?).
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;-R defines the source of your backup. In this case I&amp;rsquo;ve mounted each one of the Revo&amp;rsquo;s partitions to a similarly named mount point. Each of those mount points gets backed up.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&amp;ndash;gzip 1 tells DAR to compress the backup using the gzip algorithm. You can specify the level of compression (from 1 to 10, with 10 yielding the smallest image). Here I&amp;rsquo;ve used the lowest level of gzip compression.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;-s splits the backup into pieces (slices). I&amp;rsquo;ve specified 2GB slices, meaning when the current backup slice reaches 2GB it will start working on a new slice with a different name (it appends an incrementing number to the filename before the suffix).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;-c is the name of the actual backup. It is called a &amp;ldquo;basename&amp;rdquo; because the different slices will take on the incrementing number I mentioned above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
After those dar commands ran above I was left with the following in my backup directory (I mounted this on my laptop, thus /media/usb and not /media/backup). Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;

      <title>Acer Aspire Revo 3700 - unboxing</title>

      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2011/acer-aspire-revo-3700-unboxing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My old HTPC is something that I call a &amp;ldquo;frankencomputer,&amp;rdquo; meaning it&amp;rsquo;s been upgraded in piecemeal fashion after various OEM parts failed over the years. It may look totally new, but inside it is the same limiting, loud hardware that I started off with circa 2003. I needed some new hotness, so I started looking for something with the following criteria:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Small form factor - it had to fit into an entertainment center and &lt;em&gt;look good. &lt;/em&gt;I no longer want a huge ATX tower sitting in the middle of an otherwise sexy entertainment center.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;HD video and audio - it needed to be powerful enough to play 1080p video and decent audio (preferably SPDIF out). The old HTPC could barely play Hulu flash videos on low quality without coughing.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Low noise - the old machine sounded like an airplane during takeoff, which is to say &lt;em&gt;not good&lt;/em&gt;. Any new machine must be quiet enough so that I don&amp;rsquo;t hear it when something is playing on it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Wireless AND wired - I wanted the possibility to wire a new machine to the network as well as the freedom to connect wirelessly should I want to go that route.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
After a thorough search of Newegg and Amazon I settled on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883103297&#34;&gt;Acer Aspire Revo 3700&lt;/a&gt;. It met all of my criteria above with ease (thanks to an nvidia ION graphics processor) and was only $349. Plus, it came with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse - nice! I ordered it last Monday evening and it was on my kitchen table on Thursday:
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 700px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_001.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-582&#34; title=&#34;Revo inside!&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Revo inside!&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;525&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Revo inside!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The box felt very solid, and after opening I knew why - the Revo box itself fills the majority of the Newegg box. Only two airbags were used to fill that empty space:
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 700px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_002.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-583&#34; title=&#34;Hello goodness&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_002.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hello goodness&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;525&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Hello goodness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After opening up the Revo box itself you can find the keyboard and mouse at the very bottom. I originally thought that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be using these, but the small form factor of each of these is making me think twice! Both are smaller than the bluetooth set that I currently use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 700px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_003.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-584&#34; title=&#34;Small keyboard and mouse&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_003.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Small keyboard and mouse&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;525&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Small keyboard and mouse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a look at all the parts laid out on the table. Included with the stuff already mentioned is a laptop-like AC adapter, TV mount, vertical stand, some manuals, and of course the box itself. Yes, I was drooling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 700px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_004.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-585&#34; title=&#34;All of it splayed out&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_004.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;All of it splayed out&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;525&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;All of it splayed out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The machine itself has a luster to it. It is dark blue. Here you can see the front of it - it has the SPDIF out, a card reader, and audio ports. On the bottom left you can see a small cleft where the power button is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 700px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_005.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-586&#34; title=&#34;Revo Front&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_005.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Revo Front&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;525&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Revo Front&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning it around 90 degrees you can see a USB on the top front and the plug for another USB nearby. The top also has vents for the super-quiet fan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 700px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_006.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-587&#34; title=&#34;Revo Top&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_006.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Revo Top&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;525&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Revo Top&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where you see where all the magic happens. The back has all of the other USB ports, HDMI/VGA out, the ethernet port, and the AC adapter input:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 700px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_007.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-589&#34; title=&#34;Revo Back&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_007.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Revo Back&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;525&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Revo Back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bottom you can find some more vents and the slot for the base (which comes with it):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 700px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_008.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-590&#34; title=&#34;Revo Bottom&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_008.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Revo Bottom&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;525&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Revo Bottom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what it looks like with the stand on it. Sexy, no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 700px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_009.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-591&#34; title=&#34;All grown up!&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/01/Revo_009.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;All grown up!&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;525&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;All grown up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104704.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-564&#34; title=&#34;Grandpa&#39;s Garage&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104704-1024x764.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Grandpa&#39;s Garage&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;335&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Grandpa&amp;#39;s Garage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over Thanksgiving holiday I got the chance to briefly hang out at my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s house on Long Island. It felt great to have no work obligations and to just take in the house with the family. One thing I especially like to do when I&amp;rsquo;m there is to wander around my grandfather&amp;rsquo;s garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grandpa died seven years ago this month, but his spirit still resides in that garage. It&amp;rsquo;s partly the endless clutter of things (which it seems he saved just for savings sake) and partly the smell of grease and long-gone wood shavings from his work that make it seem special. It&amp;rsquo;s also just neat seeing all of the old hardware and parts for things waiting to be fixed. Rest assured that if anything ever breaks in grandma&amp;rsquo;s house, she&amp;rsquo;ll have a part to fix it at the ready! What&amp;rsquo;s more is that grandpa probably found that part in someones junk, was given the part for free, or otherwise obtained it outside of a store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This drawer unit was probably tossed out by his office building when he was working there. Rather than let it go to some dumpster or removal service, he found service for it in the garage (for about 30 years at that):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104202.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-565&#34; title=&#34;Drawers&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104202-1024x764.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Drawers&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;335&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Drawers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what looks like a repurposed work desk. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any guesses about this one, but you can tell from its worn paint and scratches throughout that it received a lot of love:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104457.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-566&#34; title=&#34;Work bench&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104457-1024x764.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Work bench&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;335&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Work bench&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a set of screwdrivers sitting in manually-drilled holes in a 2x4. Thrifty! Sorry for the blur:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104533.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-567&#34; title=&#34;Screwdrivers&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104533-1024x764.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screwdrivers&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;335&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Screwdrivers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a paper towel dispenser mounted on the wall. What I think is cool are those magnets for holding the pencils and pens - I use that same concept on my fridge, albeit with more geeky elements (hard drive magnets)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104610-e1292111068477.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-568&#34; title=&#34;Paper towel dispenser&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104610-e1292111068477-764x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Paper towel dispenser&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;603&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Paper towel dispenser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a funny assortment of clips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104720.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-569&#34; title=&#34;Assorted spring-loaded clips&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104720-e1292111229855-764x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Assorted spring-loaded clips&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;603&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Assorted spring-loaded clips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and more spare buckets than you can shake a stick at. Hey, you never know when you need to wash 50 cars at once!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104803.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-570&#34; title=&#34;That&#39;s a lotta buckets&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104803-e1292111288176-764x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;That&#39;s a lotta buckets&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;603&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;That&amp;#39;s a lotta buckets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dust-laden cans from who knows how long ago. Note the collection of dust:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104843.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-571&#34; title=&#34;Cans from who knows when&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104843-e1292111349726-764x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cans from who knows when&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;603&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Cans from who knows when&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way grandpa lived his life left impressions on all of us in the family, with some impressions being more subtle than the others. As I was cleaning out a jar of pasta sauce the other day, I noticed that it had measurement markings built into the the glass for cups and ounces. I thought to myself &amp;ldquo;free measuring cup!&amp;rdquo; and started to clean it off to put in the cupboard. That&amp;rsquo;s grandpa&amp;rsquo;s mentality at work! My wife politely pointed out that we already had two measuring cups and that we had no need for a third, jury-rigged one. Although it was tough to put that jar in the recycling bin, I had to agree with that logic. Maybe I would have felt differently if I had a fantastic garage, like grandpa, in which to store such things!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I recently participated in the making of the Xonotic Movement Tutorial - I provided the voice acting for the English version. In this tutorial video (shown below) both new and old players can learn tips and tricks on moving around in the new version of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Being that the physics have changed considerably, many thought the &#34;depth&#34; to movement disappeared; that the movement in the game was too easy. This is simply not true! There is still much to learn, and this video will get you well on your way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Many thanks to SINSniper (coordination), FruitieX (video editing/demo), chooksta (music), and fabzor (script) for their help in this production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I look down at my desktop calendar, I&amp;rsquo;m completely surprised that it&amp;rsquo;s the end of November &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;. Time truly does fly when you&amp;rsquo;re having fun, and apparently even more so when you are having fun with an infant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristin doesn&amp;rsquo;t welcome the upcoming winter season, but I certainly do. The different season really gives the days a new feel for me, given that it is dark when I leave for work &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; when I come home. One benefit of this is getting to see the Reston Town Center skyline as I head out the office door - it makes me feel like I work in Manhatten, as opposed to the 6 square blocks (or so) of RTC:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is my latest interview with FruitieX from Finland. We talk about his contributions to the project and some of his other interests outside of the game. What&amp;rsquo;s cool about this one is it is the first one using actual Xonotic gameplay from a development (alpha) version of the project as of &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. It also features a retextured map (aggressor) that is in the works for the new game as well!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m happy to bring you another player interview! This time I&amp;rsquo;m talking with one of the core developers of Xonotic, divVerent. We talk about some of the awesome pieces of functionality he&amp;rsquo;s worked on thus far, the importance of attitude and diversity in the community, and of course how he got involved in the game in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked for such a while that it had to be broken up into two parts! In each part the background video is from a small CTF game on Facing Worlds:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating Playlists for my MP3 Collection</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/creating-playlists-for-my-mp3-collection/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2010 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/creating-playlists-for-my-mp3-collection/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/2010/11/abcde-a-better-cd-encoder/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, about two summers back I went through my whole CD collection and digitized it to MP3 format using a tool called ABCDE. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention in that post was that at the time I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten to create playlists automatically during the process. Bummer! I had all of these albums digitized, but whenever I wanted to play a particular album I&amp;rsquo;d have to add the folder through my music player or manually select all of the files to add to my playlist. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad, but if you&amp;rsquo;ve had any experience with playlists in Windows Media Player, VLC, or even XMMS you&amp;rsquo;ll know that in practice it is just a pain to handle. For whatever reason it may be, the ordering of the album tracks on the playlist &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; gets messed up when adding manually or via folders. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Now, I know I can fix this simply by sorting by the ID3 metadata (click the &amp;ldquo;track number&amp;rdquo; column in most players to sort), but the point is that &lt;em&gt;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to do this&lt;/em&gt;. I wanted a simple solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get annoyed with these things pretty quickly, so I started thinking about how I could remedy the situation to save myself some time. Obviously I could investigate &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;each of the players were failing to sort my properly named (and usually tagged) files, but that seemed like too much work. I thought a simple solution would be to create M3U (a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CBwQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FM3U&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=m3u&amp;amp;ei=sMnWTOWRFMP-8AaXnPmZBg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHVxaaNTKNnCiADQmd33edsMs0o4A&amp;amp;sig2=OU39DvcsU8FPv3XmFXfiiQ&amp;amp;cad=rja&#34;&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt; playlist format) playlist files in each album directory that would contain the exact track ordering of that particular album. That way to play an album all I&amp;rsquo;d need to do was double click on the playlist file and &lt;em&gt;voila!&lt;/em&gt; it would play it in the right order. This would also give me the ability to drag and drop multiple albums without having to worry about sort issues with having multiple track 1s (not too much of a problem with today&amp;rsquo;s players, but still).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a little research and found a tool to help me write the playlists. It&amp;rsquo;s a Python library called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CBkQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fmutagen%2F&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=mutagen&amp;amp;ei=FsvWTPb9IoT48AblrMjYDA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHzts_jR6qh9C_NtJi1COJQEfqHWQ&amp;amp;sig2=eoawYstMNOwkQafn61uG1g&amp;amp;cad=rja&#34;&gt;mutagen&lt;/a&gt;, and it basically allowed me to programmatically read the metadata of Mp3 files to get the following information (among the many other things it can retrieve):
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Track number&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Artist name&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Album name&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Track length (seconds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
After installing mutagen, I wrote the following Python script (m3u.py) to traverse through a set of directories and create playlist files at the lowest level. For example, if I ran it on &lt;em&gt;/home/ant/Music/Coldplay/Parachutes&lt;/em&gt; I would end up with a playlist file inside the &lt;em&gt;Parachutes&lt;/em&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[python]
#!/usr/bin/python&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;import os
import sys
import glob
from mutagen.mp3 import MP3
from mutagen.easyid3 import EasyID3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def makem3u(dir=&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;):
    try:
        print &amp;quot;Processing directory &amp;lsquo;%s&amp;rsquo;.&amp;quot; % dir
        os.chdir(dir)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    # get ID3 meta objects for each mp3,
    # store in a list
    playlist = &#39;&#39;
    mp3s = []
    for file in glob.glob(&amp;amp;quot;*.[mM][pP]3&amp;amp;quot;):
        if playlist == &#39;&#39;:
            playlist = EasyID3(file)[&#39;album&#39;][0] + &#39;.m3u&#39;
        meta_info = {
            &#39;filename&#39;: file,
            &#39;length&#39;: int(MP3(file).info.length),
            &#39;tracknumber&#39;: EasyID3(file)[&#39;tracknumber&#39;][0].split(&#39;/&#39;)[0],
        }
        mp3s.append(meta_info)

    if len(mp3s) &amp;amp;gt; 0:
        print &amp;amp;quot;Writing playlist %s.&amp;amp;quot; % playlist

        # write the playlist
        of = open(playlist, &#39;w&#39;)
        of.write(&amp;amp;quot;#EXTM3U\n&amp;amp;quot;)

        # sorted by track number
        for mp3 in sorted(mp3s, key=lambda mp3: int(mp3[&#39;tracknumber&#39;])):
            of.write(&amp;amp;quot;#EXTINF:%s,%s\n&amp;amp;quot; % (mp3[&#39;length&#39;], mp3[&#39;filename&#39;]))
            of.write(mp3[&#39;filename&#39;] + &amp;amp;quot;\n&amp;amp;quot;)

        of.close()

except:
    print &amp;amp;quot;Error when trying to process directory &#39;%s&#39;. Ignoring...&amp;amp;quot; % dir
    print &amp;amp;quot;Text:&amp;amp;quot;, sys.exc_info()[0]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def main(argv = None):
    if argv is None:
        argv = sys.argv&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# directories containing music files
dirs = []

if len(sys.argv) == 2 and sys.argv[1] == &#39;-&#39;:
# we do not have command line arguments,
# so read from STDIN
   for line in sys.stdin:
       dirs.append(line.strip())
else:
# passed in directories on the command line
    for dir in sys.argv[1:]:
        dirs.append(dir)

# for each directory passed to us, go
# to it and make the M3U out of the
# MP3 files there
for dir in dirs:
    makem3u(dir)

return 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt; == &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;main&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;:
    sys.exit(main())
[/python]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can pass directories two ways this script - as arguments or via standard input. This allows me to do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;m3u.py /home/ant/Music/Coldplay/Parachutes&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;or if I wanted to do a bunch of directories in bulk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;find /home/ant/Music -type d -links 2 | m3u.py - &lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I made only a small attempt to make this script bulletproof. It gives a decent attempt to find the metadata in the MP3 files it finds in the directory, but if it encounters an error thrown by mutagen it dies out with an error message telling me the directory that failed and the exception it hit. Nine times out of ten (in my testing) the script will die because the tag information in the MP3s are malformed, which means that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to create a playlist off of them using that info anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of automating things. In almost all aspects of my life you can find an example of me trying to free up some of my time by eliminating the mundane, repeatable steps with some automated process (think auto-billpay and programmable coffee makers). This is even more evident in my computer work - I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be typing in the same commands over and over! For one, all of that typing takes time, and time is something of which I have too little. For two, me having to manually type or click things out each time exposes whatever I&amp;rsquo;m doing to human error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about one example of automation that I&amp;rsquo;ve used to save a lot of time: archiving of my CDs to MP3. I did this about two summers back when I was trying to archive my entire collection to an external hard drive I&amp;rsquo;d just bought (over 300 CDs between myself and my wife). My goal was to rip them all with:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The same level of quality (the highest quality variable bitrate MP3)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The same folder structure (&amp;lt;Artist&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;Album&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;Artist&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;Track Number&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;Track Name&amp;gt;.mp3)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Meaningful meta-info (IDv3 tags)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Playlists in the album folder (M3U files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I started with a program called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K3b&#34;&gt;K3B&lt;/a&gt; that was more than adequate in terms of my goals above, but it just took too long. After about 10 CDs I realized that the amount time to rip this way wasn&amp;rsquo;t feasible (even with two CD drives to work with in the tower I was using). To Google I went, eventually finding a neat little program called ABCDE that seemed to fit the bill.
&lt;h2&gt;Enter ABCDE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/abcde/&#34;&gt;ABCDE&lt;/a&gt; is a deceptively simple &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29&#34;&gt;Bash&lt;/a&gt; script that packs a whole host of features: Mp3/FLAC/Ogg ripping, playlists, CDDB lookups, and file tagging. What made me choose it over everything else wasn&amp;rsquo;t its feature set per se, but rather that it can be customized and simplified such that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to type out your preferences every time; you essentially set up your preferences in a configuration file &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;once&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, then forget about them! In the end I had my setup customized so that all I needed to do to rip my CDs was one of the following commands (depending on which drive the CD was loaded, of course):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;
ripcd
ripdvd
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I get to that point, you ask? Configuration, of course! Read on&amp;hellip;
&lt;h2&gt;Configuring ABCDE&lt;/h2&gt;
After you install it (which I won&amp;rsquo;t cover here), ABCDE stores its default configuration in the appropriately named &lt;em&gt;/etc/abcde.conf&lt;/em&gt;.  I started off by editing this file to make sure that it did things exactly the way I wanted (see my goals above).  Here&amp;rsquo;s an annotated guide of what I changed in the default setup.
&lt;h3&gt;Allow track padding&lt;/h3&gt;
The visual presentation of my music files is important to me. This includes how they are sorted when they are sitting in their respective folders - I wanted them to be in the folder in the same order as they are in the album! By default ABCDE doesn&amp;rsquo;t pad their track numbers (should you put them in the filename), which leads to track number &amp;ldquo;10&amp;rdquo; being shown before track number &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; if the track number is the first significant difference to the file names. Padding the track names solves this issue (it makes track 1 appear with &amp;ldquo;01&amp;rdquo; in the filename) and provides me a consistent representation in my file browser. To enable this, make this change in your config:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;PADTRACKS=y&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MP3 Encoding Parameters&lt;/h3&gt;
To get the highest quality encoding out of ABCDE I have the following LAME option (LAME is what ABCDE uses to create MP3s):

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;LAMEOPTS=&amp;quot;-b 320&amp;quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say here that encoding parameters are extremely subjective. Some folks want lossless,  while others want huge space savings. What I want is the best possible  quality while staying within the constraints of the MP3 file format. I  do that because I think lossless (FLAC) just takes up too much space. I&amp;rsquo;m also lazy in that I don&amp;rsquo;t  want to convert to MP3 if I have it archived in a different format. If you are interested in exploring other MP3 options for ABCDE here, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=LAME&#34;&gt;Hydrogenaudio Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for a pretty succinct breakdown of the other LAME options.
&lt;h3&gt;Output Location&lt;/h3&gt;
When I rip a CD, I want all of the output to go to a common location. That way I know where to look when (not if) things go wrong! Change the following options to specify where you&amp;rsquo;d like your files to go. Here I&amp;rsquo;m storing them in my home directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;OUTPUTDIR=/home/ant
WAVOUTPUTDIR=/home/ant/tmp&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to change up your temporary directory to go to a more &lt;em&gt;temporary&lt;/em&gt; location like /tmp. For me I just keep it there.
&lt;h3&gt;Output Format&lt;/h3&gt;
Here&amp;rsquo;s where things get fun. Everyone has their own file naming scheme, and rightfully so. They are your files after all, right? I like to have the artist name as a top level directory, followed by the album name in another directory under that. For the actual music files (which get placed in the album folder), I like to - again - put the artist in the name in case I want to copy just those files to a USB drive. Here is the setting to make ABCDE create this structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;OUTPUTFORMAT=&#39;${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${ARTISTFILE} - ${TRACKNUM} - ${TRACKFILE}&#39;

VAOUTPUTFORMAT=&#39;${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${ARTISTFILE} - ${TRACKNUM} - ${TRACKFILE}&#39;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that there are two lines there. The first line is for normal albums with only one artist. The second is for music compilations where you have several different artists on the same CD. This is one area that I wish ABCDE did a little better - ideally I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to specify my own &amp;ldquo;album artist&amp;rdquo; name instead of having folders for each artist on the CD, but I have another solution for that which I&amp;rsquo;ll cover in another post. For now I&amp;rsquo;m content with that flaw because I rarely purchase compilations.
&lt;h3&gt;Playlists&lt;/h3&gt;
As I said before, I want M3U playlists automatically whenever I rip a CD. This gives me a simple, one-click solution to playing an album without having to mess with bad sorting in whatever music player I&amp;rsquo;m using at the time (they all seem to mess it up). First, use this option to define the format of the M3U playlist. Here I am saying to create the file with the album as it&amp;rsquo;s name, to be stored in the album directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;PLAYLISTFORMAT=&#39;${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}.m3u&#39;

PLAYLISTFORMAT=&#39;${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}.m3u&#39;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to tell ABCDE to actually create the playlist when you rip a CD (it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do this by default). Add this to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;ACTIONS=cddb,read,encode,tag,move,playlist,clean&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of other stuff going on before the playlist generation - that&amp;rsquo;s intended.
&lt;h3&gt;Give Me My Space!&lt;/h3&gt;
By default ABCDE converts spaces and forward slashes to underscores. I&amp;rsquo;m fine with the latter, but having underscore in the filename where a space should be is endlessly annoying to me (&amp;ldquo;Pink Floyd - 03 - Time.mp3&amp;rdquo; looks much better than &amp;ldquo;Pink&lt;em&gt;Floyd&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;03&lt;/em&gt;-_Time.mp3,&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t you think?). It&amp;rsquo;s 2010 for goodness sake! Computers have evolved to be able to handle spaces in file names! Replace the &amp;ldquo;mungefilename&amp;rdquo; function with this one to keep your spaces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;mungefilename ()
{
 echo &amp;quot;$@&amp;quot; | sed s,:,\ -,g | tr /* _+ | tr -d \&amp;rsquo;&amp;amp;quot;\?[:cntrl:]
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting Up Aliases&lt;/h3&gt;
As I mentioned before, when I was using ABCDE heavily two summers ago I had aliases set up for each physical CD drive on my machine. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have two drives, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about this. If you do, and you think you&amp;rsquo;d get annoyed or tired of typing out which device from which to rip, define these aliases and put them in your ~/.bashrc. You&amp;rsquo;ll want to substitute your actual device names , of course (mine are /dev/dvd and /dev/cdrw):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;brush:bash;&#34;&gt;alias ripcd=&amp;lsquo;abcde -d /dev/cdrw&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;alias ripdvd=&amp;lsquo;abcde -d /dev/dvd&amp;rsquo;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All Together Now&lt;/h2&gt;
Okay, so now that you have the configuration, let me show you how it looks in practice. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve put a CD (Fall Out Boy&amp;rsquo;s worst CD thus far, IMO)  in my CDRW drive and used my alias to start ABCDE. What appears first is the matching CDDB entries:
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 682px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/11/abcde_1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-418 &#34; title=&#34;After executing &amp;quot;ripcd&amp;quot;&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/11/abcde_1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;After executing &amp;quot;ripcd&amp;quot;&#34; width=&#34;682&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;After executing &amp;quot;ripcd&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;After reviewing which entry looks like the best fit I choose #2 (mainly because it is listed as &amp;ldquo;rock&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;misc&amp;rdquo;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 682px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/11/abcde_2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-419 &#34; title=&#34;Choosing the second entry&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/11/abcde_2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Choosing the second entry&#34; width=&#34;682&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Choosing the second entry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I then answer a couple of questions - do I want to edit the CDDB entry (not this time, but you can with your editor of choice) and is this CD multi-artist (no again) - and it starts ripping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 682px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/11/abcde_3.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-420 &#34; title=&#34;Ripping started&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/11/abcde_3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ripping started&#34; width=&#34;682&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Ripping started&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;When everything is done ABCDE will happily drop you back to your command prompt. Here I&amp;rsquo;m inspecting the files created after the rip finished. All looks well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 717px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/11/abcde_4.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-421 &#34; title=&#34;Rip/encode done!&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/11/abcde_4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rip/encode done!&#34; width=&#34;717&#34; height=&#34;441&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Rip/encode done!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Harper&#39;s Ferry</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/harpers-ferry/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2010 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/harpers-ferry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since we didn&amp;rsquo;t get the chance to go to Harper&amp;rsquo;s Ferry last week, the family and I went this past Saturday. We set our course to West Virginia via VA Rt. 15 North after stopping at a local farmer&amp;rsquo;s market (mmm, fresh eggplant!). The weather was perfect when we got there, and the teeny town was bustling with people. Even though most of them were tourists, it was still nice to grab a day outside with the family amongst the general commotion - we strapped Layla onto our chest carrier and walked around the town for about 3 hours. Although I took many photos, I&amp;rsquo;m especially happy with the panoramas. They turned out great in the beautiful light! Here&amp;rsquo;s the first one, which is from the side of the tracks that we don&amp;rsquo;t normally walk on. Back in 1936 a flood came through that was actually higher than these - pretty amazing:
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 712px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101023HarpersFerry/hf_set_2_v1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;   &#34; title=&#34;The other side of the tracks&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101023HarpersFerry/hf_set_2_v1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The other side of the tracks&#34; width=&#34;712&#34; height=&#34;182&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;The other side of the tracks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that side of the tracks you can see the wide expanse of the town, especially the beautiful church there. Back behind the church is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Rock&#34;&gt;Jefferson Rock&lt;/a&gt;, which gets its name from Thomas Jefferson, who admired the view from there in 1783.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this next panorama you can see some more lingering evidence of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.nps.gov/applications/hafe/detail.cfm?Image_No=hf-0054&#34;&gt;flood of 1936&lt;/a&gt; in which the majority of the Shenandoah River Bridge was wiped out:
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 755px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101023HarpersFerry/hf_set_3_v1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;  &#34; title=&#34;Bridge remnants spanning the Shenandoah&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101023HarpersFerry/hf_set_3_v1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bridge remnants spanning the Shenandoah&#34; width=&#34;755&#34; height=&#34;326&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Bridge remnants spanning the Shenandoah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s awesome is that there are two such bridge remnants right off the edge of town. One spans the Shenandoah, and the other the Potomac (Bollman Bridge). Here&amp;rsquo;s a view from the existing bridge spanning the Potomac - Bollman&amp;rsquo;s Bridge is at center:
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 719px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101023HarpersFerry/hf_set_4.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; &#34; title=&#34;Two ruined bridges&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101023HarpersFerry/hf_set_4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Two ruined bridges&#34; width=&#34;719&#34; height=&#34;334&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Two ruined bridges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first visited Harper&amp;rsquo;s Ferry I assumed that these remnants were due to Civil War action. I was halfway right - the bridge spanning the Potomac was destroyed and rebuilt &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nps.gov/archive/hafe/thepoint.htm&#34;&gt;nine times&lt;/a&gt; during the war, but it was the flood that really finished it off. Fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the whole gallery of pictures I took that day. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am happy to announce the first (of many, hopefully) player interviews, where you can hear players respond to my questions while you watch a sample of their actual gameplay. In this one I talk with chooksta, who is known to all of us in the Xonotic community as both a nice guy and a talented musician. We talk about how he first came to play the game, his music, and what he&amp;rsquo;s looking forward to in Xonotic. The gameplay sample is from a game on &amp;ldquo;mentalrespace&amp;rdquo; on an Australian server. I hope you all enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enabling ClearType on Windows XP Pro</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/enabling-cleartype-on-windows-xp-pro/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2010 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/enabling-cleartype-on-windows-xp-pro/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until recently I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed the poor state of affairs in font rendering for XP (at least by default). I began to notice when I was implementing a new font for this website - the site just looked &lt;em&gt;weird &lt;/em&gt;when viewed in XP. No matter which browser I tried (IE, Firefox, and Chrome), the body text ended up looking both blocky and blurred at the same time! It was obviously something OS-specific, otherwise  I would have seen different behavior when I switched browsers (or it would look equally horrible in both Linux and Windows), but what was it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a small bit of Googling I came up with my answer: ClearType was disabled on my XP machine. What is ClearType, you ask? Well, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartypeinfo.mspx&#34;&gt;Microsoft touts it as&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;an unprecedented innovation in font display technology                      that dramatically improves font display resolution and marks a genuine                      breakthrough in screen readability&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Well isn&amp;rsquo;t that a mouthful! Here&amp;rsquo;s my explanation: ClearType is a font-prettifier for Windows. What&amp;rsquo;s good is ClearType comes built into XP by default. What&amp;rsquo;s bad is that it is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;disabled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by default. That&amp;rsquo;s not too big of a deal, though. You can get &amp;ldquo;purdy&amp;rdquo; fonts with minimal effort by simply enabling ClearType - you&amp;rsquo;re literally a couple of clicks away from making all (okay, not all, but most) of the text on your computer look better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that I just said &amp;ldquo;better.&amp;rdquo; Of course &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; is a totally subjective opinion of mine. Feel free to judge for yourself. To assist you in that process, here&amp;rsquo;s a before and after screenshot of one of my blog posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/before_and_after.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-306&#34; title=&#34;before_and_after&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/before_and_after.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;908&#34; height=&#34;440&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Can you see the difference? Does it matter to you? Do you like the right-hand side better? If you&amp;rsquo;ve answered yes to each of these questions, proceed!
&lt;h2&gt;Enabling ClearType&lt;/h2&gt;
To enable ClearType, first right click on your desktop to access the context menu there. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen it dozens of times when changing your desktop background, but here it is. Click on &amp;ldquo;properties&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 197px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/1_properties_screen.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-313&#34; title=&#34;Desktop context menu&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/1_properties_screen.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Desktop context menu&#34; width=&#34;197&#34; height=&#34;206&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Desktop context menu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then go to the &amp;ldquo;Appearance&amp;rdquo; tab and click on the &amp;ldquo;Effects&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 404px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/2_appearance_tab.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-314&#34; title=&#34;Appearance tab&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/2_appearance_tab.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Appearance tab&#34; width=&#34;404&#34; height=&#34;455&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Appearance tab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, in the effects popup, check the box that says &amp;ldquo;Use the following method to smooth edges of screen fonts&amp;rdquo; and click the &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 414px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/2_effects_menu.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-315&#34; title=&#34;Effects menu&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/2_effects_menu.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Effects menu&#34; width=&#34;414&#34; height=&#34;316&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Effects menu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Panoramas from Shepherdstown and Antietam</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/panoramas-from-shepherdstown-and-antietam/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are the panoramas that I mentioned yesterday. They were all assembled from multiple photos of the given location, then stitched together using software (about which I&amp;rsquo;ll have to write a post). Click on the images to see a bigger version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up is one of the main buildings of Shepherd University. Situated right near the downtown area of Shepherdstown, it attracted all manner of people and dogs. Very cool!
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 720px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/shepherdstowm_set_3.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-281 &#34; title=&#34;Shepherdstown University building&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/shepherdstowm_set_3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Shepherdstown University building&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;487&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Shepherd University building&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is the bridge spanning the river with the bridge remnants:
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 719px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/shepherdstown_set_2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-284 &#34; title=&#34;Ruins on the Potomac&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/shepherdstown_set_2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ruins on the Potomac&#34; width=&#34;719&#34; height=&#34;248&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Ruins on the Potomac&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venturing onto the grounds of Antietam National Battlefield, you can see a pretty good reconstruction of some fences surrounding former farmland:
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 718px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/antietam_set_1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-285 &#34; title=&#34;Antietam fence&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/10/antietam_set_1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Antietam fence&#34; width=&#34;718&#34; height=&#34;170&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Antietam fence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Lastly, and as I mentioned before, here we can see Burnside&amp;rsquo;s Bridge. So much action happened here, but it seemed so tranquil in the fading light. I&amp;rsquo;m happy I grabbed this series of images before it turned dark on me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#39;Awesome Weekend: Shepherdstown, WV and Sharpsburg, MD&#39;</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/shepherdstown-and-sharpsburg/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2010 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What an awesome weekend! To kick things off, my good buddy and fraternity brother Scott stopped by the house en route to a wedding he was attending in nearby Leesburg. We hung around and passed out early on Friday, which allowed us to get up really early (meaning 8AM) for a bike ride into Reston Town Center. We met Kristin and Layla there and had breakfast at the outstanding &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.communitycanteen.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Community Canteen&lt;/a&gt; (get an omelet - you won&amp;rsquo;t be sorry). It was a bit chilly on the way there, but on the way back the temperature warmed up and the day bloomed into something truly fall-ish. The only downside was the strong cross-breeze, which pushed us around on our bikes like it owned us. I will say one thing, though: I didn&amp;rsquo;t help my case by wearing a loose-fitting jacket that acted more like a wind sail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning had Kristin and I champing at the bit to get outside. We bid Scott adieu, then debated going to either Leesburg and Harper&amp;rsquo;s Ferry, but ended up deciding to head down to Shepherdstown, WV instead - I ran a half marathon there about two weeks prior and really enjoyed the surrounding town, and made a pact with Kristin to return (we couldn&amp;rsquo;t explore too much that day because my legs could only carry me so far). To Shepherdstown we went!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mainly walked around (not wanting to spend too much money), window shopping and site-seeing. I really enjoyed the older buildings and the personalization of the storefronts around the area:
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 629px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_005.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;  &#34; title=&#34;Hand Painted Sign&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_005.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hand Painted Sign&#34; width=&#34;629&#34; height=&#34;417&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Hand Painted Sign&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristin liked the old facades and pointed out a couple of the sites she had seen there before (she meandered around the town while I was running my half):
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 417px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_008.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;  &#34; title=&#34;Store front&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_008.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Store front&#34; width=&#34;417&#34; height=&#34;629&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Store front&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 629px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_011.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;  &#34; title=&#34;Horse step&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_011.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Horse step&#34; width=&#34;629&#34; height=&#34;417&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Horse step&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being near Antietam, you can see what must have been the remnants of some defensive action along the Potomac. It&amp;rsquo;s always cool to see this sort of stuff preserved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 629px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_028.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;   &#34; title=&#34;Destroyed bridge on the Potomac&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_028.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Destroyed bridge on the Potomac&#34; width=&#34;629&#34; height=&#34;417&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Destroyed bridge on the Potomac&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layla particularly enjoyed being carted around town. She was a total trooper - never making so much as a peep in the several hours that we were meandering around the town and in the coffee shop. She did get a little sweaty, so we decided to stop in the store so she could get some time out of her car seat with Mom and Dad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 629px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_017.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;  &#34; title=&#34;Layla and Dad&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_017.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Layla and Dad&#34; width=&#34;629&#34; height=&#34;417&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Layla and Dad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 417px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_014.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;  &#34; title=&#34;Layla and Mom&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_014.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Layla and Mom&#34; width=&#34;417&#34; height=&#34;629&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Layla and Mom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, Shepherdstown is right near &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antietam_National_Battlefield&#34;&gt;Antietam National Battlefield&lt;/a&gt;. Being the Civil War buff that I am, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist a visit! This was the second time I&amp;rsquo;d visited the battlefield and all of its grim history: the battle was the single bloodiest day in American history, with 23,000 men killed or wounded in a single day. A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;single day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;! That&amp;rsquo;s unfathomable! It was a sobering experience to walk those fields, to say the least.
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 629px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_037.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;   &#34; title=&#34;Cannon positions&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_037.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cannon positions&#34; width=&#34;629&#34; height=&#34;417&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Cannon positions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;All of those artillery positions were cool, but what really got me was visiting &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_Bridge&#34;&gt;Burnside&#39;s Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. I think it&#39;s because the bridge is still the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; bridge rather than something arranged by the National Park Service after the fact. Sure, it&#39;s been patched over the years, but the core remains the same one that sustained so much action back in September 1862, when the battle occurred. There&#39;s even a tree nearby called the &#34;Witnesses Tree&#34; because it survived the battle (when apparently others did not). Very cool indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 629px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_042.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;   &#34; title=&#34;Burnside&#39;s Bridge&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/galleries/20101017WV/WV_042.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Burnside&#39;s Bridge&#34; width=&#34;629&#34; height=&#34;417&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Burnside&amp;#39;s Bridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;After I stopped by the bridge for a few pictures, we rushed over to the observation tower near the center of the battlefield so I could get some panoramas of the overall landscape before leaving. Those pictures (along with some other panoramas I took in Shepherdstown) will have to wait for now, as they take more time to post-process - look forward to all of those at some point in the future! After taking those, we had to hurry home so Layla could get some sleep. Our timing was a little off after a bit of unexpected traffic around Harper&#39;s Ferry, so she got a little grumpy in the car on the way. Nothing that a little bit &#39;o Mom + bottle couldn&#39;t handle! Bottle in mouth, she calmed down for the rest of the trip and  arrived home almost ready to pass out. It was a big day for us all, but especially for her. She hung onto Mom and Dad for another hour before succumbing to the call of lala-land. Kristin and I ate dinner, then plopped on the couch for some much needed football time. Weekend, complete!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Update 10/29/2010: Here&#39;s the whole gallery of pictures taken that day, including the panoramas I posted later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes simply being a parent takes up your day. Yesterday was one such day, when Layla needed constant attention after being awake for a marathon-like (for her) 5 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hours. After playing in the mirror, hanging out in the high chair, and swinging in the swing, she just wanted more! I&amp;rsquo;d look over at her in the crib after she&amp;rsquo;d tricked me into thinking she was tired, only to find a big toothless smile and happy eyes looking back at me. What a cutie!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first reaction after several iterations of this was frustration, but this soon gave way to feelings of guilt. After all, these are the days that I should cherish! Soon she&amp;rsquo;ll be crawling and thereafter will start becoming more and more independent each day. That means what I have right now is so, so special. Having realized that yesterday towards the end of my (our?) ordeal, those feelings of frustration melted away, leaving me there to soak up the experience for what it was.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mindful Running Hacks</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 640px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/rcsaxon/542566756/&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;Runners&#34; src=&#34;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1351/542566756_db45e39778_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Runners&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Image courtesy of Richard Saxon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love running; I&amp;rsquo;m a runner. On weekends, early in the morning, and even during my ever-decreasing lunch breaks, I run. I feel like it gives me the clairvoyance needed to tackle whatever problems I&amp;rsquo;m having in my life at the moment. As an example, right now I mostly focus on how to solve programming problems by putting them on the back-burner of my mind while my feet hit the pavement repeatedly. It&amp;rsquo;s therapeutic! It&amp;rsquo;s also a huge benefit to your body, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have to tell you that, right? There are a few problems that I have to consider when running, though. Long distance running can be a mind game in which winning means enjoying your run and losing means experiencing pure agony for each centimeter traveled. This post is about handling that mind game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that long distance running is completely relative to each person and their experience. I&amp;rsquo;m sure &amp;ldquo;long run&amp;rdquo; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Salazar&#34;&gt;Alberto Salazaar&lt;/a&gt; means 20+ miles in a single stretch. It can be relative on other things, too - 5 mile runs seem much longer when you are running in 90 degree, 80% humidity weather, don&amp;rsquo;t they! For purposes of this post my &amp;ldquo;long&amp;rdquo; runs are those of 5 miles or longer only because that seems to be a sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: when I&amp;rsquo;m running long distances, I tend to psych myself out when I think too much about how my body is performing. I get into an endless loop of assessment similar to the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How is my breathing - is it too rapid, too conversational?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How is the &amp;ldquo;chaffage&amp;rdquo; situation - are my armpits, legs, etc uncomfortable?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Am I getting enough water, carbs?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How am I doing on my target pace?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
While certainly useful in a long race, this constant checking and re-checking makes me &lt;strong&gt;too aware&lt;/strong&gt; of any degradations in my performance. Translation: by constantly assessing myself, I find that I actually decrease my performance. Not good! To remedy this self-imposed issue, I employ one or more of the following &amp;ldquo;mindful running hacks&amp;rdquo; to keep my mind in check and to get more enjoyment out of my runs. I call them mind&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; because they don&amp;rsquo;t really involve your physical self; these things deal exclusively with the battles you can have inside your mind when running long distances. Anyway, here goes&amp;hellip;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a mantra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
A mantra is something - a phrase, song, word - that you repeat over and over either physically or mentally to occupy your mind&amp;rsquo;s conscious thoughts; it&amp;rsquo;s really just a big distraction, not at all unlike when you think about your summer vacation (or other happy times) when you are in the dentist&amp;rsquo;s chair. I use mantras to zone out when running. I tend to go with some sort of positive or realistic phrase pertinent to my route. Examples:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This is how I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;supposed &lt;/em&gt;to feel&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;insert some lyrics of a song I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to here&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Calm, cool, collected, &lt;em&gt;confident&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;X (substitute X with whatever mile/km you are currently on)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I find they are effective as such, but relatively boring overall. This means that the longer my run is, the less likely I am to utilize this one. I have to break up the monotony, which leads me to my next point.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Break up the run into chunks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
I break down my long runs into manageable chunks, and I only focusing on one chunk at a time. In the middle of my 10 mile run, I think about the plethora of other 5 mile runs I&amp;rsquo;ve completed with no problem. I will myself to forget the miles that are increasingly behind me - what&amp;rsquo;s left is what matters, and what&amp;rsquo;s left is shrinking with each step! I find that I break down my runs into roughly half-mile increments. That&amp;rsquo;s probably a byproduct of my watch&amp;rsquo;s capacity to store lap information, but you can use whatever works for you.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Positive thinking, visualization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
I know, it sounds lame. But if it is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Cant-Accept-Not-Trying-Excellence/dp/0062511904/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1278002864&amp;amp;sr=8-3&#34;&gt;good enough for Michael Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be good enough for me? I envision my run before and during my actual run. This helps me anticipate how I am going to physically feel as I take step after step. Knowing what to expect mid-race makes me feel more in control, thus boosting my confidence. What I do is think mostly about how my body is going to handle the most difficult portions of a given route - that big up/downhill, the slippery rock or dirt section, etc.  - then I play that section in my head over and over. With repetition comes boredom, so when I actually encounter the obstacle I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem so bad.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Use Jeff Galloway&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;dirty tricks&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
I have a book called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Marathon-You-Can-Jeff-Galloway/dp/0936070250&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marathon: You Can Do It!&amp;rdquo; by Jeff Galloway&lt;/a&gt;, the running guru. In it he provides a couple of mind techniques to use that he calls &amp;ldquo;dirty tricks.&amp;rdquo; All of them are more or less distraction techniques, but I want to bear mention of them here. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried each with success, although with a slight bit of embarrassment. The good thing is that no one has to know - it&amp;rsquo;s all in your head!:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pretend that you and the person in front of you are lashed together with a giant rubber band. Envision the tension of that rubber band is propelling your body forward and past your opponent.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In an effort to decrease the influence of the right brain when running (which seems to be the dominant half when doing so, for some reason), do math or other analytical (non-logic) problems that help engage your left brain. The idea is to shift the balance between your left and right brains to keep your mind fresh.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Imagine a giant hand is guiding you through the difficult parts of the race, gently pushing you so as to relieve part of your strain.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Glide vs. Stride - switch up your stride every once in a while. Go from short, choppy strides to long ones where your feet barely clear the ground. Note: this one isn&amp;rsquo;t just a mental trick. The physical changes help your muscles go longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Get Angry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
When I really can&amp;rsquo;t get myself into gear, I imagine things that make me angry. I envision all of my friends laughing at my speed (or lack thereof) or I replay an embarrassing incident in my life. When I do this I feel the immediate need to improve; to prove that those incidents are behind me and I am now a better person. Really though, I tend to use this as a last resort because it is negative thinking.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In conclusion&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
So there you have it - my list of things I use to make my runs less mind-numbingly difficult. I find that if I use the things I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned here my long runs (those of 5 or more miles, but your YMMV) become enjoyable because I&amp;rsquo;m not endlessly diagnosing myself and my performance. Rather, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on generally positive thoughts or distracting myself altogether. Either way I see a net benefit in becoming more fit and enjoying it all the while!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New sculptures in RTC</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/new-sculptures-in-rtc/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2010 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/new-sculptures-in-rtc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday on my almost daily walks around Reston Town Center I spotted two new sculptures cropping up in the park across from the Rolls Royce building. From the signs nearby they are made out of recycled wood posts.
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 471px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-198 &#34; title=&#34;RTC sculpture 1&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;RTC sculpture 1&#34; width=&#34;471&#34; height=&#34;630&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;The first new sculpture in RTC, fully assembled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 472px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_2_wip.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-199 &#34; title=&#34;RTC sculpture 2&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_2_wip.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;RTC sculpture 2&#34; width=&#34;472&#34; height=&#34;630&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;The second new sculpture in RTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;It is pretty cool how they are propping the red sculpture up - a clue as  to how it may look when finished? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but it looks good. Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture taken a little while later (the next afternoon):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 472px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_2_wip2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-201 &#34; title=&#34;RTC sculpture 2&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_2_wip2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;RTC sculpture 2&#34; width=&#34;472&#34; height=&#34;630&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Second shot of the red sculpture going up, taken a day later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Keeping your sanity with an infant</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/keeping-your-sanity/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2010 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/keeping-your-sanity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Those of you who know me personally also know that I had a baby girl this past Easter (Layla, on &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). It has been a tiring, stressful, and &lt;em&gt;totally wonderful&lt;/em&gt; experience! What I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about specifically are the first two points (the tiring and the stressful) and four things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to cope with them. I hope these things will benefit you. If they do, great! If not&amp;hellip;well, forget about everything I said and go about doing whatever it was you were going to do anyway :). Here goes&amp;hellip;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Sleep when baby sleeps&lt;/h3&gt;
When my little girl is crying, my ability to properly diagnose the situation almost entirely depends on how rested I am. I know that the more rested I am, the more clear mind mind will be. Is she hungry? Is she too hot? Does she have gas? I&amp;rsquo;ll never figure it out if my mind is too cloudy. That means it is extremely important for me to get as much sleep as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therein lies the problem - you don&amp;rsquo;t have much time for sleep. At least I thought I didn&amp;rsquo;t at first. I learned after a few hard weeks that I had to lay down and sleep when Layla went down, else I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be sleeping at all. Surprisingly, the amount of sleep I was getting after a few weeks of doing this increased dramatically because I was better able to handle/fix whatever was bothering Layla. She&amp;rsquo;d been giving me the signs all along (turning her head when hungry, kicking her legs when gassy, etc) and I&amp;rsquo;d just been to tired (or too dumb) to pay attention. Addressing those issues quickly and correctly calmed her down and prevented &amp;ldquo;meltdowns,&amp;rdquo; which then increased her snooze-time.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make connections with other people in your same situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
My wife and I felt alone in the first few weeks after Layla was born. None of our close friends had newborns and we didnâ€™t feel comfortable going to a â€œmommyâ€ or â€œdaddyâ€ meetup in our city. We eventually sucked it up and started scheduling lunches and dinners with other parents who weâ€™d met through mutual friends or work. We figure that doing this created win-win situations for us: we get to talk with people who experience the same issues while making new friends at the same time. Who wouldâ€™ve thought (duh, right)? Plus, I developed a bunch of ideas (or avoided roadblocks altogether) through conversations with these new friends. They really are wonderful exchanges, with each side of the table contributing something or other that makes life with an infant just a little bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think all it took was that little connection with the outside world to make us feel like we were still part of something, instead of feeling like we were on an uninhabited island where no one else had kids.
&lt;h3&gt;3. Change up your scenery&lt;/h3&gt;
This really goes without saying, but I feel I have to say it anyway: you &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to change up your surroundings or else you are going to go insane. I am especially prone to cabin fever, but it seemed amplified knowing you have the weight of another human relying on  you 100% on your shoulders. For whatever reason, Kristin and I stayed in the house more often than not. I donâ€™t know what it was that kept us there for so long, but after a while we grew determined to make it easier to go out and about. We critically analyzed our process management science style, which resulted in the following decisions:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We opted against a traditional diaper bag, going with a backpack instead. We already owned a backpack (diaper bags are not cheap, by the way), and it allowed us to have two arms totally free to handle other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We got a portable changing pad like this [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.walmart.com/ip/Summer-Infant-ChangeAway-Portable-Changing-Pad-Diaper-Kit/12960886?sourceid=1500000000000003260330&amp;amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;amp;ci_sku=12960886&#34;&gt;http://www.walmart.com/ip/Summer-Infant-ChangeAway-Portable-Changing-Pad-Diaper-Kit/12960886?sourceid=1500000000000003260330&amp;amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;amp;ci_sku=12960886&lt;/a&gt;]  and pre-populated it with all of the change stuff weâ€™d need.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We bought a different, lighter weight stroller for the &amp;ldquo;quick trips&amp;rdquo; out. We love our Chicco, but it gets left at home when we&amp;rsquo;re heading to the mall.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Formula! We used to keep those freezer packs in our bag to keep the milk cold. Nowadays we just bring a pre-measured amount of formula along with bottles with the corresponding amount of water. Hungry baby? Mix, shake, and your done. Many thanks to our neighbors who let us borrow a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Sassy-Powdered-Formula-Dispenser-Multiple/dp/B000067PIZ/ref=pd_sbs_misc_2&#34;&gt;tupperware formula thingamajig&lt;/a&gt; to dispense the formula powder in the least messy fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
With these changes made, getting out of the house wasn&amp;rsquo;t such a big deal any more. Hooray!
&lt;h3&gt;4. Make daily goals for yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
Nothing feels better than checking things off of your TODO list. What I do is make little lists with what I want to accomplish during the day. These become my daily goals which made me feel good about my day when completed. Take note  - these aren&amp;rsquo;t mind-bendingly awesome goals or long term in any way, but rather simple things that moved my new life further a little bit at a time:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Folding the laundry (ugh, what a dreaded task)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Calling back a friend&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;De-cluttering my desk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
As Bill Murray says in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103241/&#34;&gt;What About Bob?&lt;/a&gt;: baby steps, baby steps! Checking off those baby steps - no matter how little -  feels &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Tiny Apple</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/the-tiny-apple/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With all of the diet gimmicks in the world, everyone seems to forget that there is another option to lose weight: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;just eat less&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Well, almost everyone - Panera Bread seems to get the concept. They offer apples as a low-calorie alternative to their chips. How low-cal you ask? Take a look for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/tiny_panera_apple_01.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-125&#34; title=&#34;Teeny tiny Panera apple&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/tiny_panera_apple_01-300x224.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Teeny tiny Panera apple&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;224&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;A teeny tiny Panera apple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are my eyes just playing a trick on me or is that a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tiny apple? Hmm, let me check - ah, yes! I brought my own apple as a snack today for comparison:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#39;Coffee in Leesburg &#39;</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/coffee-in-leesburg/</link>

      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/coffee-in-leesburg/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another weekend, another Leesburg trip! The town just has so much to offer. &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/2010/04/awesome-chalk-art/&#34;&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d mentioned the awesome coffee shop that I am just &lt;em&gt;compelled&lt;/em&gt; to visit each time I&amp;rsquo;m there. Here&amp;rsquo;s part of the reason why: not only do they have excellent coffee, but they are also steeped in local history. According to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.talkloudoun.com/walking-in-their-footsteps-three-generations-of-shoes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Talk Loudon&lt;/a&gt;, the window countertops at the front of the store were made from the original shoe shine stand and the bookcases inside were assembled from shoe shelves. During their recent renovation they found some 1920s-era shoes that now hang from the center chandelier. Adorning the front entrance is what appears to be the original shoe repair sign, which I just love:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 225px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0067_1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-111&#34; title=&#34;The Shoes coffee shop sign.&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0067_1-225x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Shoes Cup &amp;amp; Cork Club sign&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something in me also loves old signage, and this is about as good as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the side you&amp;rsquo;ll find an alleyway to their back, &amp;ldquo;secret&amp;rdquo; garden:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/alley_1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-120&#34; title=&#34;Alley to the secret garden&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/alley_1-300x210.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alley to the secret garden&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;210&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Alley to the secret garden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides coffee, the shop sells food which can be enjoyed on their back patio (at the end of the alley above), which is also eloquent. I especially like the lighting up above and the surrounding old buildings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0061_1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-116&#34; title=&#34;Overhead lighting&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0061_1-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Overhead lighting&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Overhead lighting in the secret garden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Awesome Chalk Art</title>

      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/awesome-chalk-art/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Found in the &amp;ldquo;Shoes&amp;rdquo; coffee shop in Leesburg (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shoescupandcorkclub.com/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Amazing! Here is an overview shot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/wpid-2010-04-02-13.54.56.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some detail on the 80s guy on the right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/wpid-2010-04-02-13.55.15.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;trucker realism? Check. Now we have the superhero Captain Planet on the left:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wow, That Was Fast!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not usually a fan of the stupid stuff most websites do on April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day, but I like what Google is doing with their search results. Note the subtlety:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 561px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/google_subtle_fun.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-77 &#34; title=&#34;google_subtle_fun&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/04/google_subtle_fun.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fast search results&#34; width=&#34;561&#34; height=&#34;163&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Wonky search speeds from Google on April 1st&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users are also noting some other fun search speed variations:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;nanocenturies&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;gigawatts (from Back To The Future)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;parsecs (from Star Wars)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;femtogalactic years&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;microfortnights&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;centibeats&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;centons&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;shakes of a lamb&amp;rsquo;s tail&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;epochs (time since Jan 1st, 1970 in computer time)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;microweeks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;at &lt;em&gt;NN &lt;/em&gt;hertz&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;at warp &lt;em&gt;NN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This beats their most obvious joke hands down, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you say?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Key to a Long Lasting Marriage</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/marriage/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently the key to a long lasting marriage is by keeping track of it through &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theknot.com&#34;&gt;The Knot&lt;/a&gt;. Kristin uses the site to get to our guest list data, which the site happily stores for us. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that nice? Here&amp;rsquo;s what the home screen looked like when she logged on recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/03/theknot1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/03/theknot1.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Knot&amp;#039;s informative, docile home page&#34; title=&#34;The Knot home page&#34; width=&#34;492&#34; height=&#34;245&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-50&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatively benign, right? Wait a minute&amp;hellip;something isn&amp;rsquo;t right here! Let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been away from this little internet space for about two and a half years. Sorry about that. In my own defense, I was in grad school, purchasing a house, quitting jobs, finding other jobs, and watching movies (lots of movies). My goal from now on is to add content to this site regularly as a means to express myself and to own my own content. I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting under a couple of categories, the first two being &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;galleries.&amp;rdquo; They mean exactly what you think they mean - a &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; category post means a post contains the ramblings of my brain/personal opinion, howtos, geek stuff, etc etc. The &amp;ldquo;galleries&amp;rdquo; category means the post will be used to post my images. Simple, right? Right. I hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still deciding what to do with all of the older content (from college and what has been stagnant for the past 2.5 years). I may re-post, but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
