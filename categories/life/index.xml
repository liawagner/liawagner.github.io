      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having just finished the third book of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/076536543X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=076536543X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=randthouandge-20&amp;amp;linkId=RVFXZURL5Q4MBGP5&#34;&gt;Mistborn
Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;, I must admit I&amp;rsquo;m surprised. What I thought to be a quick and easy read went much deeper than expected. Looking back on them all I have to commend Sanderson on his well formulated plot arc. By the end all of the pieces fit together nicely, but in a way you couldn&amp;rsquo;t exactly see coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intro blurbs are always interesting, but almost never revealing. If
you were to go back and read them again after having read the book I&amp;rsquo;m sure
they&amp;rsquo;d clue you into the things to come, but chronologically they serve only to
pique your interest and keep the pages turning. They give little nuggets of
writing from different authors about events surrounding the story, but never in
a direct way. It all serves to draw you in more, and it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting itself is apocalyptic, which I always like. In my suburban life of
Starbucks and Wegmans it is compelling to read about an earth covered in ash,
with earthquakes shaking the ground often to remind everyone of the coming end.
Death or violence is always just around the corner too, so you always have
apprehension about the main characters every time they venture out to do
something. That being said, Sanderson is not as blood or lust-thirsty as George
R. R. Martin, so there is some aspect of timidity to it all. The deaths of enemies
and friends alike are treated briefly but definitively and without elaboration. This helps move the plot forward quickly. With so much plot to cover this helps the overall pace of the book greatly. I never felt like the book was dragging along in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise itself is pretty interesting. People have the ability to gain
certain abilities when they ingest metals. Pewter, for example, gives physical
strength and balance. Steel allows a person to &amp;ldquo;push&amp;rdquo; on other metals, which
yields a sniper-like ability to fire coins at others. There are 16 metals in
total, but the trilogy only refers to a subset. I suspect this is mainly to
allow for future expansion of the franchise, but it does also serve to maintain
plot-level interest in whether or not the characters will expand their
capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the metals are covered in sufficient depth, Sanderson doesn&amp;rsquo;t linger
so much that it becomes boring. I did note that he briefly re-describes the
things they do within each new novel which is to be expected. It isn&amp;rsquo;t
annoying in the slightest. Also, at the end of each book you&amp;rsquo;ll find a quick
reference to all the metals and what they do, eliminating any possible
confusion for those on-again, off-again or forgetful readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I really appreciated in these books was the lack of predictability.
Oftentimes in novels you can guess where the plot is going well in advance. Not
so with these, so that was refreshing! The author intentionally leaves items or
situations unresolved. What&amp;rsquo;s more is that he turns major plot characters
inside out as the series progresses (e.g. the Lord Ruler), and he does it in a
way that makes complete sense. It gives you that satisfying feeling of puzzle
pieces snapping into place after a long but subtle nagging thoughts in the back
of your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m happy that my coworker recommended this series to me. Overall it was a
highly entertaining read with excellent re-read value. I also have a new author
to watch for in Brandon Sanderson. Given how prolific he is it looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll
have quite the selection for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2015: The Year In Music</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2016/2015-the-year-in-music/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Another year of music is in the bag. 2015 was a good one! Once again we crack
open &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/antzucaro/8212369&#34;&gt;summarizr&lt;/a&gt; to see
what we have&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;which-artists-did-we-listen-to-the-most&#34;&gt;Which artists did we listen to the most?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nine Inch Nails (261)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frank Turner (246)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tame Impala (227)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deadmau5 (225)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awolnation (158)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coldplay (156)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metallica (146)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pink Floyd (142)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less Than Jake (136)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The War on Drugs (129)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stats this year are a bit skewed because I replaced my Revo 3700
 (a full-sized computer) with a
 Raspberry Pi 2 (a credit card sized computer) to save a bit on power. In the process I converted from using
 MPD to Kodi, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time until recently to address Last.FM
 scrobbling with the latter. Oh well, it is still interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails&#34;&gt;NiN&lt;/a&gt; comes in at the top spot this year. I think this is mostly me listening
 to &amp;ldquo;The Fragile&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Hesitation Marks&amp;rdquo; at work. I find both of those
 albums familiar enough that they don&amp;rsquo;t distract me while coding, yet still
 block out enough of the ambient office noise to make a difference with respect
 to flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Turner&#34;&gt;Frank Turner&lt;/a&gt; is the real newcomer here. I came across his stuff while perusing
 CDs at the Cascades Library. The particular album was &amp;ldquo;England Keep My Bones,&amp;rdquo;
 and I fell in love immediately. I went out and purchased his catalog as soon
 as I could, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t regretted a minute of it. He has a fantastic voice
 and moving lyrics. I highly recommend him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other crush of the year was with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala&#34;&gt;Tame Impala&lt;/a&gt;, who released their (yes, I
 know it is
 really one guy) album &amp;ldquo;Currents&amp;rdquo; after much anticipation. It was and is
 everything I expected, and has been in constant rotation. My favorites from
 the album are &amp;ldquo;The Less I Know the Better&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Reality in Motion&amp;rdquo;. Rock on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.last.fm/music/Awolnation&#34;&gt;AWOLNATION&lt;/a&gt; came out with another one during the year as well, which didn&amp;rsquo;t
 disappoint. I expected a good amount of weirdness along with his singing
 magnificence and that&amp;rsquo;s what I got! Favorites from this one are &amp;ldquo;Hollow Moon&amp;rdquo;
 and &amp;ldquo;Woman Woman.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-many-different-artists-did-we-listen-to&#34;&gt;How many different artists did we listen to?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;502 (versus 727 last year)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to put too much stock into this figure for this year. I didn&amp;rsquo;t
listen to nearly as much SomaFM and I ended my Spotify subscription as
well. This meant I was on my own media-wise. I have a broad and diverse
collection, but it can&amp;rsquo;t compare to those of the larger services out there.
Oddly enough, Spotify spammed me to death towards the end of the year with a
three-for-one deal that I could have taken. If I knew the music-listening
situation at my new job, I might have agreed to it! As it stands I don&amp;rsquo;t know
how musically oriented the office is, and I&amp;rsquo;d rather not give off a bad
impression as &amp;ldquo;the new guy with the headphones on all the time.&amp;rdquo; Maybe next
time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-many-tracks-did-we-listen-to-per-month&#34;&gt;How many tracks did we listen to per month?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January: 978&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February: 623&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March: 1052&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April: 1266&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May: 822&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June: 726&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: 891&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August: 845&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September: 554&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October: 386&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November: 278&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December: 355&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at these numbers I can guess that I swapped computers at some point in
September. The scrobbling count dropped dramatically during that time! I didn&amp;rsquo;t
even get my yearly boost from SomaFM&amp;rsquo;s Christmas channel in December. Shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;which-artists-did-we-listen-to-the-most-by-month&#34;&gt;Which artists did we listen to the most by month?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January: Toy (67)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February: Nine Inch Nails (46)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March: Frank Turner (94)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April: Ramin Djawadi (96)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May: Thomas Newman (84)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June: Pink Floyd (32)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: Boston (37)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August: deadmau5 (189)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September: Metallica (40)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October: Nine Inch Nails (40)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November: Nine Inch Nails (45)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December: Coldplay (51)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.last.fm/music/Toy&#34;&gt;Toy&lt;/a&gt; takes January, when I was definitely on a psychedelic rock kick. I
think I came across them on Tame Impala&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;similar artists&amp;rdquo; page. They take a
little getting used to, but remain a solid choice if you&amp;rsquo;re a rock fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.last.fm/music/Ramin+Djawadi&#34;&gt;Ramin Djawadi&lt;/a&gt; is another notable on this list. He did the
soundtrack for Game of Thrones, and with the show playing during the month we
certainly took advantage of the album. If you&amp;rsquo;re in the mood to feel epic while
you&amp;rsquo;re doing household chores, this is the guy to queue up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another noteworthy artist here is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.last.fm/music/Boston&#34;&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;. After reading a random Reddit comment
about how the group recorded and produced their first album (in short: Tom
Scholz being amazing), I picked it up. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t already have
it, given how amazing it is. Every single song on the album is still in
rotation on the ratio, even today. Crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-song-did-we-listen-to-the-most&#34;&gt;What song did we listen to the most?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.last.fm/music/The+War+on+Drugs&#34;&gt;The War on Drugs&lt;/a&gt; - Under the Pressure (16 plays)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise that I really like indie and psychedelic rock, so of course
this track makes sense. I love the way this guy blends different sounds
together, and that is immediately apparent in this track. Listen to it and
you&amp;rsquo;ll see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-many-different-artists-did-we-listen-to-per-month&#34;&gt;How many different artists did we listen to, per month?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January - 75&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February - 75&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March - 102&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April - 110&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May - 88&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June - 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July - 118&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August - 125&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September - 92&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October - 49&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November - 58&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December - 48&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with my diversity
for the year. I try not to get into any ruts, and it is clear that didn&amp;rsquo;t
happen. Continued visits to the library and various thrift stores should help
to keep these numbers similar in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-album-did-we-listen-to-the-most&#34;&gt;What album did we listen to the most?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The War on Drugs - Lost in the Dream&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check this guy out. Indie rock at its best!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there went 2015! All in all a pretty decent year of music. I look forward to
what 2016 brings, although I can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;ve heard much about what to expect.
Maybe a new full-length album from the Foo Fighters or perhaps NiN? I&amp;rsquo;ll be
happily grooving regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maine Vacation - Day 1</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2015/maine-vacation-d1/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2015 08:33:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2015/maine-vacation-d1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following quickly on the tail of our Rehoboth weekend, we chose to do our &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; vacation in Maine this summer. As usual it was in early August, but unlike usual we were able to drop the kids off with our parents so we could take a (mostly) worry-free trip. While this is all fine and well, it did mean that we had to travel down to Hampton Roads to drop off the kids at &amp;ldquo;grandma camp&amp;rdquo; first. As anyone near a beach area knows, the beach traffic is terrible, and we hit the brunt of it. A three and a half hour trip took us seven full hours, with Kristin steaming at the wheel the whole way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the beach to stay one night with my mother in law before flying up North. While there we went down to the actual beach to enjoy the calm, warm bay water. The kids absolutely loved it for those two qualities! Gone were the pulling undertows and crashing waves of Rehoboth. In their absence the kids could find their confidence in the water again. It was really a joy to see them out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2015/8/MaineD01/l/C_Maine_0463_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;The mid-day light shines into the condo at the beach&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;The mid-day light shines into the condo at the beach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2015/8/MaineD01/l/C_Maine_0475_l.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Beach time for all of my girls!&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;Beach time for all of my girls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I took a stroll down the beach to get myself in the mood for lots of photographs to come. What I captured was a completely different scene from the one I found in Delaware. Being a private beach, there weren&amp;rsquo;t nearly as many people! It was basically the condo residents and their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As the sun went down we all went in for a Bob-made dinner. It was fantastic! I will certainly remember the fried eggplant made by a true Italian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After dinner Layla and I went back down to the beach to get some sunset shots. Everyone had cleared out by this point, and the sky was showing off its color. We took a few shots of the sky and went back in. I had an early flight!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rehoboth</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2015/rehoboth/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2015 17:30:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2015/rehoboth/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We just got back from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. It was just a weekend trip, with each of us taking Friday off to make the four hour trip worthwhile. It was also planned last minute, as I got an email from my manager with my &amp;ldquo;use it or lose it&amp;rdquo; tally of vacation days I&amp;rsquo;d yet to use!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at the Crosswinds Motel, which was technically three blocks away from the beach. Unfortunately those are the longest three blocks on the planet! It had to be a solid half-mile from our room to the boardwalk. At least it was a pretty walk, with all manner of mom-and-pop stores to keep our eyes occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the cleanliness of it all. Every shop seemed extremely tidy and I saw almost no derelict buildings. I suppose I just don&amp;rsquo;t know where to look to find them! The loitering was also kept to a bare minimum, but that could be a side effect of our de facto curfew on account of having the kids along with us. For most nights we were back in our room by 8:30 PM in order to start the bedtime routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boardwalk itself was impressive and to the point. It is only a mile long, making it the perfect distance for an evening walk. With such a short space to work with, it seems like all the junk businesses were pushed out, further down the highway. It was like night and day compared with our experiences in the Kitty Hawk and Virginia Beach areas, where you see cheapo beach storefronts every other block. In their place is a varied arrangement of eateries and clothing companies offering some legitimately cool stuff. Dolles, a taffey and fudge place, occupies the best location of all of these and also sports the biggest signage. It&amp;rsquo;s been there since the 20s making sweets on premises, which I&amp;rsquo;m sure cements its status as a must-see (despite it really being a can&amp;rsquo;t-miss).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beach itself was crowded, as expected. We got th stink eye from one family, only to have them realize our respect for their boundaries wasn&amp;rsquo;t shared by other beach-going families. Before the end of the day three more groups of people had squeezed into the &amp;ldquo;personal space&amp;rdquo; we&amp;rsquo;d initially given them. It became so congested that we had to snake our way through all sorts of umbrellas and towels just to reach the beach not more than 20 feet in front of us! Once we eventually did reach the water, the kids didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave. It was an exercise designed to test our vigilance, and it was exhausting. All I wanted to do was sleep or read my book, but I had to keep my eye on the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dinners were nice and relatively inexpensive. The first night we went to Nicola Pizza, where the kids had pizza by the slice and the adults had nic-o-bolis. After having two people independently recommend this place, I can safely add in my support as well. The place was clearly a classic, the food was tasty, and the service was fantastic. I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely pay them a visit next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second night we wanted to get some seafood, so we did a quick check on Yelp via the hotel&amp;rsquo;s wifi (side note: cell phone reception in the area is atrocious). Good reviews led us to the Purple Parrot Grill &amp;amp; Bar, but a bad attitude towards strollers and kids led us across the street to another seafood place called Claws. The latter location not only set us up quickly &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the building (the Parrot would have relegated us to the side alleyway), but also had designated stroller parking painted onto their bounding fence. Nice! Bonus points for kid friendliness. Oh, and their food was great too. Kristin and I split some shrimp amongst ourselves and couldn&amp;rsquo;t even finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I go back to Rehoboth, I suspect it will be during a somewhat off-season time of year. The crowds were absolutely insane, making the beach real estate slim-pickings. All the people also add a certain level of ambient noise into the mix, making that peaceful &amp;ldquo;ahh, I&amp;rsquo;m at the beach&amp;rdquo; feeling somewhat hard to find. Despite these things I think it is still a lovely place to visit. There&amp;rsquo;s lots to do in a quite compact area, and it is within a short drive of the DC Metro area. We will certainly be back!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2014: The Year In Music</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2015/2014-the-year-in-music/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 16:15:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;2015 is well underway, so it is time to reflect on last year&amp;rsquo;s music landscape. I dusted off &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/antzucaro/8212369#file-summarizr-go&#34;&gt;summarizr&lt;/a&gt; to grab a data-centric view of my music world in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;which-artists-did-we-listen-to-the-most&#34;&gt;Which artists did we listen to the most?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pink Floyd (262)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C418 (235)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nine Inch Nails (200)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Mayer (176)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daft Punk (160)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less Than Jake (150)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Bowie (133)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Led Zeppelin (127)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carbon Leaf (126)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metallica (123)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No surprises here. Pink Floyd came out with their mostly-ambient album &lt;em&gt;The Endless River&lt;/em&gt; towards the end of the year and I listened the hell out of it. No shame there - they&amp;rsquo;ve been my favorite band since high school and I&amp;rsquo;m perfectly fine without Roger Waters&amp;rsquo; egotism in the band. My favorite modern band, Nine Inch Nails, is always going to be on the list as well. They&amp;rsquo;re a perfect fit for the kind of work I do at the computer. David Bowie is the only relatively newcomer on the list. I got into his greatest hits by chance and found myself going back to it again and again as the year went on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-many-different-artists-did-we-listen-to&#34;&gt;How many different artists did we listen to?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;727 (versus 591 last year)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one was eye-opening. Every year I promise to myself to expand my musical horizons and end up listening to the same stuff. Last year I bucked that trend and I believe I have Spotify and Soma.fm to thank. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a big fan of Pandora due to the lack of an official thick client, so Spotify fills that need quite nicely. Their radio advertisements are a small price to pay for an awesome app overall and it shows. I keep those streams a-streamin and my musical taste expands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-many-tracks-did-we-listen-to-per-month&#34;&gt;How many tracks did we listen to per month?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January: 1056&lt;br /&gt;
February: 533&lt;br /&gt;
March: 740&lt;br /&gt;
April: 922&lt;br /&gt;
May: 642&lt;br /&gt;
June: 1062&lt;br /&gt;
July: 1073&lt;br /&gt;
August: 483&lt;br /&gt;
September: 882&lt;br /&gt;
October: 862&lt;br /&gt;
November: 528&lt;br /&gt;
December: 621&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t really draw much from this statistic, but I like to look at it nevertheless. I can only theorize that May and August are low in the totals department because of my yearly hike and vacation, respectively. Those are entire weeks where I&amp;rsquo;m not hitting a web-accessible playlist. That&amp;rsquo;s by choice and I&amp;rsquo;ll keep doing the same next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;which-artists-did-we-listen-to-the-most-by-month&#34;&gt;Which artists did we listen to the most by month?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January: Carbon Leaf (40)&lt;br /&gt;
February: Nine Inch Nails (34)&lt;br /&gt;
March: John Mayer (61)&lt;br /&gt;
April: C418 (89)&lt;br /&gt;
May: Nine Inch Nails (72)&lt;br /&gt;
June: The Doobie Brothers (67)&lt;br /&gt;
July: C418  (72)&lt;br /&gt;
August: Queen (26)&lt;br /&gt;
September: Daft Punk (37)&lt;br /&gt;
October: Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (43)&lt;br /&gt;
November: The Rolling Stones (49)&lt;br /&gt;
December: Pink Floyd (58)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably my favorite set of stats because they really show my listening habits throughout the year. January began with a heavy dose of Carbon Leaf with their album &lt;em&gt;Ghost Dragon Attacks Castle&lt;/em&gt;. Although the album came out just about one year prior, we weren&amp;rsquo;t on their mailing list then and didn&amp;rsquo;t notice. I certainly noticed in January. March is when I discovered a ton of free live shows from John Mayer on &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/JohnMayerMusic&#34;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;, so I was putting those to work. I like how you can pick shows from your area in particular - it is almost like being there! In July we watched &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.minecraftstoryofmojang.com/&#34;&gt;Minecraft: The Story of Mojang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and I fell in love (all over again) with C418. I ended up purchasing his albums &lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Volume Beta&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;One&lt;/em&gt; and that meant a lot of logged tracks. October saw the release of the movie &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; and along with it the soundtrack by two of my favorite artists, so that got heavy use as well. December saw the long-awaited release of Pink Floyd&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Endless River&lt;/em&gt; which had me immediately drooling. I&amp;rsquo;m still drooling now over it, as a matter of fact! I&amp;rsquo;ll probably play that album later today&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-song-did-we-listen-to-the-most&#34;&gt;What song did we listen to the most?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Doobie Brothers (It Keeps You Runnin&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really have anything else to add here. What a weird track to have listened to the most! I have no explanation other than the Doobies are awesome in general. No shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-many-different-artists-did-we-listen-to-per-month&#34;&gt;How many different artists did we listen to, per month?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January: 193&lt;br /&gt;
February: 112&lt;br /&gt;
March: 85&lt;br /&gt;
April: 96&lt;br /&gt;
May: 72&lt;br /&gt;
June: 125&lt;br /&gt;
July: 76&lt;br /&gt;
August: 69&lt;br /&gt;
September: 169&lt;br /&gt;
October: 106&lt;br /&gt;
November: 79&lt;br /&gt;
December: 131&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another category which I like but against which I can&amp;rsquo;t draw many conclusions. Who knows what can explain July&amp;rsquo;s relative lack of diversity. Perhaps I was too distracted by the spike in work that comes yearly during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-album-did-we-listen-to-the-most&#34;&gt;What album did we listen to the most?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minecraft - Volume Beta (108 tracks)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend C418 enough for the programmers out there reading this. He&amp;rsquo;s
a phenomenal artist, and he will help you get in the zone. His tracks have just enough tempo to keep your head bobbing but not enough to create a distraction. I find it completely conducive to deep thinking, so you can imagine why the listen-count is so high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great year of music. I think we used Spotify and Soma.fm to the
fullest. I&amp;rsquo;m happy with what I listened to, and I can only
look forward to what 2015 brings to my ears!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ceiling Fan</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2015/the-ceiling-fan/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Six and a half years we&amp;rsquo;ve been living in this house. Not a large amount of
time by any stretch, but surely a long enough period during which one would figure
out how all of the lights about the house work. Not so! My four and a half year
old discovered just this morning that the main fan light in our master bedroom
operates on a dimmer. My wife and I were dumbfounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this time I&amp;rsquo;d thought something was defective about
the remote: turning the light on or off required several clicks to obtain a
response. It turns out that this is actually some sort of toggling function. If
you continue to hold down the button, the light alternates between increasing
or decreasing brightness. Wonderful! My daughter, having no preconceptions of the
thing, figured this out rather quickly. Me, with my years of so-called
&amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo; with it, did not. I guess that goes to show that sometimes all it
takes is a fresh perspective to help you grok things. There&amp;rsquo;s learning to be
had in the most unlikely places, and even after long periods of time&amp;hellip;like six
and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>12 Years a Slave</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2014/12-years-a-slave/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2014/12-years-a-slave/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We watched &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/12_years_a_slave/&#34;&gt;12 Years a Slave&lt;/a&gt; the other day. Soon afterward, having thought about it for a bit, I jotted down my thoughts and reactions. In no particular order, here they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rare use of music really caught my attention. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like Castaway in that regard. Only items or ensembles directly tying into the story line are included, with very few exceptions. Platt had his fiddle that he brought out on occasion, and there were points in the story where they used gospel-like singing (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; tells me the term gospel wasn&amp;rsquo;t in existence during that period of time). The very few times when non-inclusive sound was used were in very impactful scenes. During these they would use low and almost monotonous chords which heightened the emotional feel of the respective scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of us appreciated the true to life encounters throughout the film. In reality people come and go in our lives - villians are there for brief periods, then they fade away with no &amp;ldquo;arc-like&amp;rdquo; resolution to be found. Such is how it went in this movie, and it was refreshing. We see bad people who don&amp;rsquo;t get vengenance as well as good people who do nothing but add short, bright spots to an otherwise deplorable situation. There was no closure in sight for these characters because that&amp;rsquo;s the way life is. I&amp;rsquo;m happy that the writers avoided the temptation to do typical Hollywood wrap-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is obviously a movie about slavery, but the usage of long scenes made us feel the suffering much more than just digesting what was happening. When Solomon is tied up to a tree for almost an entire day, the camera lingered on him for what felt like forever. We saw friends and enemies walk by him, unable or unwilling to help. We&amp;rsquo;re meant to put ourselves in Solomon&amp;rsquo;s shoes and to feel his helplessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overt use of the color black adds a worse-than-bleak feel to the movie. It brought out feelings of desperation and a complete lack of hope. In a scene where Solomon is forced to burn a letter, we can see his hope burning away with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some scenes were zoomed way too much, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why. We see steam boat paddles and Michael Fassbender&amp;rsquo;s eyes in two different scenes, and I can&amp;rsquo;t really say they did anything for me. I&amp;rsquo;m sure they meant something, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some character weaknesses brought on by poor development or just sub-par acting. I felt Brad Pitt&amp;rsquo;s character came out of nowhere, even though he plays a crucial role in how things turn out. He deserved a bit more development besides just being a carpenter that showed up one day. As it is, his character and his surrounding story weren&amp;rsquo;t believable (though the film is based on a true story). Beyond him, I also thought the woman who played the slaver&amp;rsquo;s wife over-acted, with the result being a robot-like performance. Her character was supposed to be cold and unforgiving, not inhuman!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came in thinking it was going to be Chiwetel Ejiofor&amp;rsquo;s show, but it turned out to be Michael Fassbender&amp;rsquo;s. He showed unbelievable acting skill and great dedication to his role. All throughout he played the perfect psychopath slaver. I look forward to seeing more of him! I&amp;rsquo;m sure with this performance he&amp;rsquo;ll get a lot more offers in the future. Cheers to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the movie is well worth seeing. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be writing about it if otherwise! Let the scenes marinate in your mind a bit and they&amp;rsquo;ll work their way into your conscious thoughts. I know they have merged into mine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coder&#39;s Block</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2012/coders-block/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jun 2012 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m in a bit of a rut when it comes to getting things done in the software world. When I get home, I want to physically take care of things around the house instead of hack. Instead of working on XonStat, I look forward to pruning the trees in the front yard and planning for the next home improvement. This is strange for me, as I’m used to coming home and pruning things in my &lt;i&gt;software&lt;/i&gt; late into the night and loving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will admit that recent events have taken their toll on me. Maybe they’ve even altered the way I  view software of late. See, two weeks back my wife went through surgery to remove her cancerous thyroid. I didn’t want anyone in the waiting room with me, so I was mostly alone through the rather long surgery. To burn the time and to keep my mind off of things I brought my laptop to the hospital with me. Of course as soon as she was wheeled away from me that laptop was on and humming, and my fingers streaming keys into my vim console as fast as I could think them up. That day I developed a ton of features for XonStat, but I wonder if that day also associated the activity of coding with feelings of loneliness and depression in my subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t that the hospital itself was depressing either. By all means everything about our situation was positive. Besides the fact that she had cancer, Kristin’s diagnosis was the best one possible. They’d caught it early and it wasn’t life threatening. Despite this the whole situation was still overwhelming, and I think it impacted me more than I initially thought. When everything happens so fast I suppose you don’t have the luxury of really analyzing your situation. You’re just along for the ride, and you’re lucky enough if you can think about it deeply later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever it may be that’s contributing to my code block, I have a plan to counteract the damage. I’m going to start small because I think that is the answer. I’m going to do some trivial change - refactor some code, maybe - just to drive some feeling back into my fingers. With any luck the little pebbles I’ll move with that teeny change will start a landslide in my development activity again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welp, I&amp;rsquo;ve made my progress on coding. It was &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/antzucaro/XonStat/commit/9f4a482f6194a036232e55b6e6917305ab98589c&#34; title=&#34;yeah, teeny&#34;&gt;trivial&lt;/a&gt;, but I hope it will whet my coding appetite! I just did the commit a few minutes back. It felt good, but more importantly it felt natural. That&amp;rsquo;s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Baltimore Aquarium</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2012/baltimore-aquarium/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Mar 2012 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2012/baltimore-aquarium/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we went to the Baltimore Aquarium with my parents. What a
fantastic trip! We started off the day at about 7AM, packing everyone
into the Ford at 8AM and scooting off as fast as we could towards I-95. The
Aquarium has a slot-based approach to tickets, and each slot lasts for
about 30 minutes. Our slot was for 9:30, which meant we had just over an
hour to get there from Sterling. Given the rush we stopped at Dunkin
Donuts - a guilty pleasure - for some flatbread and sugary coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived just in time and went inside, where Layla was super excited
to see all the fish in their front-lobby tank. It reminded me of what
the Bass Pro Shops in Hampton has in their store, with all of the
natural habitat replicated to fit a modern interior. Past this area you
come to a wide-open area where they have some sharks and stingrays in a
giant ground floor tank. Layla was wide-eyed and mesmorized, repeating
all of the words we told her in her best drone voice: &amp;ldquo;ray,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;shark&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making our way up the escalators (which were awesome, given the building
is rather small horizontally but huge vertically) we saw her favorite
thing of the day: a huge green sea turtle we hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen down below. It
cruised around the area with only one front fin, which told us it was
probably a rescue. They began to feed it lettuce and Layla told us the
play by play! She even said &amp;ldquo;turtle eating leaf,&amp;rdquo; which made our jaws
drop. On this second floor we also saw a &amp;ldquo;Nemo&amp;rdquo; fish (clownfish), a Nautilus,
and an octopus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going up a floor we went into the rainforest area, which was super humid
for what we were wearing. We didn&amp;rsquo;t see too many animals there,
which was a bit disappointing. The one bird we did see had a
piercing &amp;ldquo;fox call&amp;rdquo; that made us want to leave immediately. We did see an orange monkey and a sloth
way up in the treetop, though. We moved on pretty quickly because we
were so uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you reach the top of the building, you start making your way down
through other various tanks and exhibits. I really enjoyed seeing the
sand tiger sharks during that part. They&amp;rsquo;d slowly glide by, showing off
their teeth like they were proud of them. Kristin was weirded out by one
of the sharks that looked like it was staring her down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch time came about and we went out to the Hard Rock Cafe. All the
memorabilia there is so awesome - Eddie Vedder&amp;rsquo;s guitar case, Elvis&amp;rsquo;
robe and grammy nomination letter, Keith Richards&amp;rsquo; guitar, and many more
things. Even though we had to wait for about 45 minutes for lunch to
arrive, the food was great. Plus, they have LCDs everywhere playing
music videos, so I was at least entertained. Layla was dead tired by
this time, though, and she fell asleep in Pa&amp;rsquo;s lap until the food
arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went home and Nanny&amp;rsquo;s job was to keep Layla awake for the car ride. The
technique worked and we were all rewarded with a much-needed nap! It was
a good capstone to a day well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Surprised by a Sentence</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2012/surprised-by-a-sentence/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2012 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2012/surprised-by-a-sentence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As time has gone on I think I&amp;rsquo;ve grown accustomed to the leaps and bounds by
which Layla grows weekly. Every once in a while, though, she&amp;rsquo;ll really
drop a stunner that leaves me reeling, bringing me back down to earth
with just how much she&amp;rsquo;s progressing. Just last night as I was getting
her ready for bed, she looked up at me and matter-of-factly said &amp;ldquo;I want
to see the video with the rhino with the horn.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;d been watching some
Youtube videos of rhinos that she&amp;rsquo;d really enjoyed, and I&amp;rsquo;d been talking
to her about the horns on top of their nose. For most of the night she&amp;rsquo;d
say one or two words about the videos, but nothing like the complete
sentence that came out later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s just shy of 23 months old today, and I find it totally
jaw-dropping that she&amp;rsquo;d come up with a sentence of that complexity this
early. I guess it reaffirms my belief that she knows full-well
how to speak in her mind - she&amp;rsquo;s just working on how to get it out! I&amp;rsquo;ll
certainly continue to speak to her in full sentences. From the looks of
things soon enough she&amp;rsquo;ll be responding in kind!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Second Brew Coming Soon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The second batch of beer is well on its way! This time around I&amp;rsquo;m brewing an amber called Autumn Amber Ale, which can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.midwestsupplies.com&#34; title=&#34;Midwest Supplies Home Page&#34;&gt;Midwest Supplies&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike my previous one (a hefeweizen), for this batch I will be doing two stage fermentation; I will leave the mix in my plastic bucket for a week, then transfer it to a glass carboy for another week. Hopefully this will give me a clear and consistent brew since a lot of the sediment is excluded during the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the wort below 80 degrees I chilled it by setting it in cold water, all the ice from the icemaker, and several of my running water bottles that I&amp;rsquo;d frozen overnight. The combination was just enough – the mixture was cool after only 15 minutes of sitting in the sink. This was a huge improvement over last time, where I had to wait for hours after accidentally pouring the hot wort into the cool tap water for cooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these improvements from last time I still have some things I can improve upon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could purchase the extra gallons of water in advance. These gallons could be stored in the fridge to cool much more than tap water, further decreasing the amount of time I&amp;rsquo;d have to wait before pitching the yeast. This would also give me better filtration, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure the tap water is less “pure” than that in the packaged containers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to start earlier in the day next time. I stayed up until almost midnight. Instead of waiting for Layla to go to sleep, what I could do instead is have Kristin keep her occupied while I take care of the most dangerous part of the process (until the chance of a boil over is eliminated).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I remove any of the ingredients, I can put a small note in the ingredient boxes on where I put things. The yeast in this current kit had to be refrigerated, so naturally I did so when I received the kit in the mail. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t do, however, was to let my future self know where I&amp;rsquo;d put it. This led to me frantically looking for the yeast with my boiling wort almost ready because I forgot that I put it in the fridge. A simple post-it note in the ingredient box saying “yeast is in the fridge – MM/DD” would have avoided the anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could find a longer thermometer. The short one that I used would fog up because it was so close to the steam coming off of the wort. I also don&amp;rsquo;t like having my hand so close to the hot mixture. If possible I&amp;rsquo;d like to have a safer alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making beer isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly difficult. It is time consuming and precise, but all it really boils down to (no pun intended) is following instructions and engineering the process to go smoother each time. As I iterate my process each time I&amp;rsquo;m getting closer and closer to that goal of “smoothness” while enjoying a delicious reward each time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I love about Kristin is her propensity to bury herself in good novels. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve caught her in the act back in 2007. She&amp;rsquo;s still the same today: her nose in a book but nevertheless aware of her mischievous husband with the camera!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Business Parent and the Fun Parent</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2011/the-business-parent-and-the-fun-parent/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2011 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2011/the-business-parent-and-the-fun-parent/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past month Kristin and I have realized that Layla views us in two very different lights: I&amp;rsquo;m the &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; parent and Kristin is the &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; parent. Let me explain. The business parent is the one who gets right into the task at hand. If it is changing time, then that time is for changing and not much else; it isn&amp;rsquo;t a time for playing with toys or making many jokes during the process. The business parent leaves such things for their own time (usually just after the change is done in my prior example) - they are in essence taking care of business!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fun parent, by contrast, integrates playful activities into these routines. When changing that diaper, for example, the fun parent integrates some toys into the picture or may play a game or two with the things on the table. The key is that a &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; activity is integrated into the otherwise &amp;ldquo;not fun&amp;rdquo; activity with the idea that the overall experience is better for the child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, these two roles are not mutually exclusive; I still do my fair share of tickling on the changing table just as much as Kristin gets things done. By and large, though, I&amp;rsquo;m the parent that just wants the chore-type things to be done with as fast as possible and Kristin is the type to encourage play all throughout. In other words, we&amp;rsquo;re both pretty close to the middle of the spectrum when it comes to that aspect of parenting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has some really interesting implications on Layla&amp;rsquo;s behavior. What she seems to be doing is tailoring her reactions to the parent she&amp;rsquo;s with at the time. For example, when Kristin puts her in the car seat (what I&amp;rsquo;d call a &amp;ldquo;not fun&amp;rdquo; activity for her), Layla will stand up and fool around, avoiding at all costs getting strapped in safely. If I do the exact same thing, however, she&amp;rsquo;ll sit  and watch calmly as I buckle her in (albeit with a little fussing). I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is the start of some more serious manipulation in the future (e.g. I go to Mom when I want shoes) or if she&amp;rsquo;s just forming basic associations at this point. Either way she&amp;rsquo;s a clever, wonderful little bean!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Completing The Appalachian Trail In Shenandoah</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2011/completing-the-at-in-shenandoah/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2011 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2011/completing-the-at-in-shenandoah/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started off on Friday, &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Tired of I-81 and all of the trucks, I decided to take Route 29. I got to Sawmill Run Overlook in 2.5 hours, but took a wrong turn because the moon shed no light on the SNP sign just off the exit. Further complicating things was a convoluted network of roads to get to the actual Skyline drive. I got there and listened to Pink Floyd until Tommy arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got there around 10:45 and we immediately started looking for the trailhead in the pitch black of the night. Once found, we stashed my stuff in his car, hid my valuables in mine, and sped off to Humpback Mountain overlook about 17 miles South. At the overlook we used his car lights and our headlamps to find a good bandit camping location just off the lot. We found a decent one and set up the best we could. I crawled into my hammock and slept hard. A key decision to me sleeping so hard was bringing my down 10 degree bag instead of my 40 degree one. The weather was already 50 degrees when we got there and was dropping fast. The breeze was pretty strong, so the warmth of that bag plus the cooling factor of the breeze was just the right formula for knocking me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up to the sunlight at about 6:15. Once I stirred Tommy was up as well, and we were off to stowing all of our excess junk into his car; getting rid of all this weight (sleeping bag, hammock) really helped us move quickly on the trail. Our normal 18 lb pack was shaved down to 8 or so. We hit the trail at 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped early on at an overlook to admire the mountains we&amp;rsquo;ve come to love over the years we&amp;rsquo;ve hiked them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 660px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sped along the trail, full of energy. Soon we hit a pretty big spring:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 660px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;
&lt;img width=&#39;650px&#39; height=&#39;486px&#39; alt=&#34;A huge spring&#34; title=&#39;A huge spring&#39; src=&#39;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/05/ATHike/IMG_0309_m.jpg&#39;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;A huge spring &lt;a href=&#39;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/05/ATHike/IMG_0309_l.jpg&#39;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;See this image in full size&#39; src=&#39;https://chriswayg.github.io/static/fs_img.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about an hour of hard hiking we came upon a little side trail which led to a group of unmarked graves. We counted 15 of them, 14 of which had no identifiable information on them - just an upended piece of slate. Only one of them had writing we could discern: M.C. Lowe, born in 1866. Very cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 660px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;
&lt;img width=&#39;650px&#39; height=&#39;486px&#39; alt=&#34;A plot of unmarked graves&#34; title=&#39;A plot of unmarked graves&#39; src=&#39;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/05/ATHike/IMG_0311_m.jpg&#39;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little ways down the trail we came upon the remnants of the family to whom some of those graves belonged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 660px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went so blazingly fast along the trail we had walked seven miles before we even broke a sweat! The weather was perfect with a gentle breeze and a temperature in the mid 50s. For our speed and effort level it balanced out nicely. Given that we hadn&amp;rsquo;t had any breakfast thus far, we stopped on the side of the road at Rockfish Gap and the entrance to Shenandoah National Park. We sat and ate some breakfast and watched the cars go by on I-64 below. Behind us the Inn at Afton loomed large, reminding us of our stay there a few years back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another hiker came along and we chatted for a bit as we finished up our lunch. Turns out he&amp;rsquo;s from Bristol, VA and he&amp;rsquo;s thru-hiking. He bags about 20 miles a day and is looking to hit that distance before nightfall. He bids us well and heads on his way before we think to ask him his name. We head out shortly thereafter, taking in some more scenery. As we&amp;rsquo;re leaving we get a surprising horn blast from a trucker below which eggs us on our way. We didn&amp;rsquo;t even ask for it! The trail is nearby, and it breaks immediately upwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We go up and up with a lot of effort on a poorly graded (in my opinion) path which leads us to a relatively even plateau. As we reach the top we encounter all of these communications towers. Equipment is everywhere and the atmosphere is humming with electricity. It&amp;rsquo;s all very surreal being in a national park with such surroundings. There is a fire road for what must have been construction access and a strange looking amphitheater of sorts outside the main complex. What&amp;rsquo;s cool about the amphitheater is the seats - they were sunk into the ground instead of having legs! Only pictures will do them justice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the sun out in full and the temperature rising, we finish off the rest of the plateau and start to head down. Opening up before us is a beautiful field&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 660px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;
&lt;img width=&#39;650px&#39; height=&#39;486px&#39; alt=&#34;A huge plain opens up before us&#34; title=&#39;A huge plain opens up before us&#39; src=&#39;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/05/ATHike/IMG_0330_m.jpg&#39;&gt;

&lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;Beautiful clouds &lt;a href=&#39;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/05/ATHike/IMG_0331_l.jpg&#39;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;See this image in full size&#39; src=&#39;https://chriswayg.github.io/static/fs_img.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;at the bottom of the plain we catch back up with the thu hiker we&amp;rsquo;d seen earlier. We stop and chat for a little while longer and find out that his trail name is &amp;ldquo;No Cello&amp;rdquo; (he&amp;rsquo;s a cellist). We tell him about the awesome blackberry milkshakes available throughout the park and also warn him about the rollercoaster just above it. We also help ourselves to some trail magic put there by a section maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;wp-caption aligncenter&#39; style=&#39;width: 496px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#39;&gt;
&lt;img width=&#39;486px&#39; height=&#39;650px&#39; alt=&#34;Woohoo! Trail magic!&#34; title=&#39;Woohoo! Trail magic!&#39; src=&#39;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/05/ATHike/IMG_0332_m.jpg&#39;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#39;wp-caption-text&#39;&gt;Woohoo! Trail magic! &lt;a href=&#39;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2011/05/ATHike/IMG_0332_l.jpg&#39;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;See this image in full size&#39; src=&#39;https://chriswayg.github.io/static/fs_img.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We part with No Cello for the second time. We&amp;rsquo;re in the lead and heading up the steep incline towards Jarman Gap. It is noon at this point, and Tommy and I both start to talk about what to do for lunch. We usually have a tradition of going to Waffle House afterwards, but this time we feel like beers and burgers instead. We count the minutes and try to map them to miles for an hour and a half until we actually see my car at the top of the trail. No Cello by this time had caught back up to us to wish us goodbye as we both hopped in my car and went into Waynesboro for some food.
The trail has been good to us on this trip and we&amp;rsquo;re both thankful. We&amp;rsquo;ve had good weather, reasonable good terrain, and some good sites. Thanks, Shenandoah!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Beautiful Wedding in Hampton, VA</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2011/a-beautiful-wedding-in-hampton-va/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This weekend my lovely sister Amy got married to her best friend Mike. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to have had the opportunity to be a part of the event alongside my wife Kristin and baby girl Layla. We each had an awesome time! While all of these great images are fresh in my mind I thought I&amp;rsquo;d solidify them e-paper for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake! Here are some of my newly formed memories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-day-before&#34;&gt;The Day Before&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The breeze is cool and refreshing, and the weather is in the upper 60s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone in the wedding party makes it to the base (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Monroe&#34; title=&#34;Fort Monroe&#39;s Wiki entry&#34;&gt;Fort Monroe&lt;/a&gt;) in time for the rehearsal, but the officiant isn&amp;rsquo;t there. He&amp;rsquo;s having car trouble and arrives almost an hour late. Tensions are high, but the wedding party goofs around on stage anyway. We all make jokes about the stupid stuff we could do while up in the gazebo in front of all the wedding guests. Cheesy winks and finger-points, anyone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four years after our siblings started dating I finally meet the sister of the groom. Katie and I laugh about having missed meeting each other after so many years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a long and intense debate, the groomsmen collectively decide that they will clasp their hands in front, with their right hand over their left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we simulate the ring placement Mike goes for Amy&amp;rsquo;s right hand. Amy gives him a smack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we break for the rehearsal dinner, which is about 10 minutes away, Kristin and I are in such a rush to get there we leave our umbrella stroller at the base. We conveniently realize our mistake as we get ready to head into the restaurant. Not wanting to go back for a $20 stroller, we go into a Target nearby and get another $20 stroller. We arrive fashionably late to the rehearsal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The food at the rehearsal dinner is crazy good. The offerings are eggplant parm, spaghetti and meatballs, and lasagna. I go with the lasagna and Kristin goes with the eggplant parm. I devour mine quickly and without shame - I&amp;rsquo;m starved. Layla must be starved too, because she eats all of Kristin&amp;rsquo;s pasta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layla is the biggest ham in the world. She cheeses at everyone in the room, really shining that beautiful smile of hers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amy is having a great time. She pokes fun at Mike and cackles loudly at the jokes the bridesmaids are making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the way home I notice a tickle in my throat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-day-of&#34;&gt;The Day Of&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wake up with a full blown sore throat. It feels like my tonsils are two golf balls. After dropping Kristin off at the hotel to get ready w/ the girls I grab some Alka Seltzer from Target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The day is noticeably colder than the day before. It&amp;rsquo;s in the low 60s but still beautiful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get to the hotel around 1:30. The traffic is much worse than I thought because apparently there is some boat show going on. It takes me 15 minutes to go a couple of blocks on Mercury to the hotel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I drop Layla off in a room with a whole bunch of squealing bridesmaids. Amy has her hair done and is looking great! They have an assortment of fruit which I help myself to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amy gives Layla a kiss on the cheek, leaving some permanent lipstick there. We have to work with the makeup artist to get it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I head up to the groom&amp;rsquo;s room (one floor up) to get myself ready. I forgot how to tie a half-windsor and look it up on my phone. Sean uses the instructions too and is soon equipped with a balla knot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike&amp;rsquo;s dad helps us all with our boutonnieres, and Matt helps me with my pocket square. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how intricate the folding for that thing had to be - it&amp;rsquo;s like oragami!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brian lightens up the mood in the room by playing Frank Sinatra&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Love and Marriage&amp;rdquo; on his iPod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The men break off into Mike&amp;rsquo;s dad&amp;rsquo;s van while I head back down to the bridesmaid&amp;rsquo;s room to pickup Kristin and Layla. We head to the venue, where I drop off the two ladies into the limo which carried the other bridesmaids there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not supposed to be wearing sunglasses, but I had to use them to drive. I stuff them in my pocket to prevent myself from putting them on. I spit out my gum as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grandma&amp;rsquo;s knees are bothering her and she wants to sit down. Even though not many people are seated yet, I escort her to her seat in the second row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ceremony begins without a hitch and everyone is in their positions. Layla comes down the aisle in her little cart oblivious to everyone around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The officiant is in a jovial mood and throughout the whole thing comments on how &amp;ldquo;awesome&amp;rdquo; things are. Amy and Mike fill a flower vase with two colors of sand in lieu of a unity candle, which I think is very cool (it will certainly last longer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the time comes to put on Mike&amp;rsquo;s ring he has trouble getting it over his knuckle - he has freakishly large knuckles, apparently. Before the cermony he even lubed up his finger with conditioner from the hotel, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work very well. The ring eventually goes on (never to come off again, right?) with some force by Amy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amy and Mike are declared husband and wife and they head back down the aisle to much applause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layla is freaking out so Kristin&amp;rsquo;s mom takes her to the car. Kristin and I stay back to take some pictures in the now freezing weather. The breeze got to us after a while! We take a break in Steven&amp;rsquo;s car to warm up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Amy finishes up taking pictures she finds a ladybug in the grass. Good luck! Walking away one actually lands on her dress. Double good luck!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-reception&#34;&gt;The Reception&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had to drive Layla back to the hotel to go to sleep, so we arrive at the reception fashionably late. Fortunately Dad has our dinners held for us. We gobble them down - Kristin had beef and I had chicken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am very impressed with the candy bar. I was skeptical about it leading up to the event, but I&amp;rsquo;m sold as soon as I see it. Gummy worms, Yorks, mints, and everything else. Great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grandma has a great time dancing with Brandon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dad only has two beers throughout the night, but he dances like he&amp;rsquo;s had about 8. Grandma enjoys watching her son let loose on the dance floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The photo booth (provided by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shutterbooth.com&#34; title=&#34;ShutterBooth main website&#34;&gt;ShutterBooth.com&lt;/a&gt;) is a big hit with all guests. For each set of photos taken Amy and Mike get an entry in a &amp;ldquo;guestbook&amp;rdquo; of sorts and the people in the pictures get a copy as well. Brilliant! I take a funny set of pictures with Kristin, Evan, and Lia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Katie, sister of the groom, leads an awesome pop quiz game for Amy and Mike. Each is asked questions about the other in turn, with each of them writing their answers for comparison purposes on whiteboards. They differ on some answers but in an insignificant way - it seems as if the other person&amp;rsquo;s answer is just as good of an answer as the one they provided on their own (e.g. Amy would love to go to Alaska as much as she&amp;rsquo;d like to go to Europe).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main dessert is in the form of a full platter of assorted cupcakes. They are unbelievably good and decorated well to boot. I hear they were made by a friend or employee of VBPD. Great job, whoever you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone grabs glow in the dark wavy-things to greet Amy and Mike as they head out of the reception hall. They come out of the door and into an explosion of cheers and well wishes.
In summary everyone had a blast. I was extremely happy to see my sister&amp;rsquo;s wedding go so well and also to see her so happy. I welcome my new brother in law to the family!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Grandpa&#39;s Garage</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104704.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-564&#34; title=&#34;Grandpa&#39;s Garage&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104704-1024x764.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Grandpa&#39;s Garage&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;335&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Grandpa&amp;#39;s Garage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over Thanksgiving holiday I got the chance to briefly hang out at my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s house on Long Island. It felt great to have no work obligations and to just take in the house with the family. One thing I especially like to do when I&amp;rsquo;m there is to wander around my grandfather&amp;rsquo;s garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grandpa died seven years ago this month, but his spirit still resides in that garage. It&amp;rsquo;s partly the endless clutter of things (which it seems he saved just for savings sake) and partly the smell of grease and long-gone wood shavings from his work that make it seem special. It&amp;rsquo;s also just neat seeing all of the old hardware and parts for things waiting to be fixed. Rest assured that if anything ever breaks in grandma&amp;rsquo;s house, she&amp;rsquo;ll have a part to fix it at the ready! What&amp;rsquo;s more is that grandpa probably found that part in someones junk, was given the part for free, or otherwise obtained it outside of a store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This drawer unit was probably tossed out by his office building when he was working there. Rather than let it go to some dumpster or removal service, he found service for it in the garage (for about 30 years at that):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104202.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-565&#34; title=&#34;Drawers&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104202-1024x764.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Drawers&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;335&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Drawers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what looks like a repurposed work desk. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any guesses about this one, but you can tell from its worn paint and scratches throughout that it received a lot of love:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104457.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-566&#34; title=&#34;Work bench&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104457-1024x764.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Work bench&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;335&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Work bench&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a set of screwdrivers sitting in manually-drilled holes in a 2x4. Thrifty! Sorry for the blur:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104533.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-567&#34; title=&#34;Screwdrivers&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104533-1024x764.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screwdrivers&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;335&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Screwdrivers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a paper towel dispenser mounted on the wall. What I think is cool are those magnets for holding the pencils and pens - I use that same concept on my fridge, albeit with more geeky elements (hard drive magnets)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104610-e1292111068477.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-568&#34; title=&#34;Paper towel dispenser&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104610-e1292111068477-764x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Paper towel dispenser&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;603&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Paper towel dispenser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a funny assortment of clips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dust-laden cans from who knows how long ago. Note the collection of dust:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104843.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-571&#34; title=&#34;Cans from who knows when&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101127_104843-e1292111349726-764x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cans from who knows when&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;603&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Cans from who knows when&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way grandpa lived his life left impressions on all of us in the family, with some impressions being more subtle than the others. As I was cleaning out a jar of pasta sauce the other day, I noticed that it had measurement markings built into the the glass for cups and ounces. I thought to myself &amp;ldquo;free measuring cup!&amp;rdquo; and started to clean it off to put in the cupboard. That&amp;rsquo;s grandpa&amp;rsquo;s mentality at work! My wife politely pointed out that we already had two measuring cups and that we had no need for a third, jury-rigged one. Although it was tough to put that jar in the recycling bin, I had to agree with that logic. Maybe I would have felt differently if I had a fantastic garage, like grandpa, in which to store such things!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Here comes winter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I look down at my desktop calendar, I&amp;rsquo;m completely surprised that it&amp;rsquo;s the end of November &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;. Time truly does fly when you&amp;rsquo;re having fun, and apparently even more so when you are having fun with an infant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristin doesn&amp;rsquo;t welcome the upcoming winter season, but I certainly do. The different season really gives the days a new feel for me, given that it is dark when I leave for work &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; when I come home. One benefit of this is getting to see the Reston Town Center skyline as I head out the office door - it makes me feel like I work in Manhatten, as opposed to the 6 square blocks (or so) of RTC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 450px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/11/RTC_nov.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-large wp-image-527&#34; title=&#34;The view of the SW corner of RTC&#34; src=&#34;https://chriswayg.github.io/uploads/2010/11/RTC_nov-1024x764.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The view of the SW corner of RTC&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;335&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;The view of the SW corner of RTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/cataldo/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;     &#34; title=&#34;Baby next to diapers&#34; src=&#34;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/34/116811768_ed57f12c16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Image courtesy of Aldo Risolvo on Flickr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes simply being a parent takes up your day. Yesterday was one such day, when Layla needed constant attention after being awake for a marathon-like (for her) 5 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hours. After playing in the mirror, hanging out in the high chair, and swinging in the swing, she just wanted more! I&amp;rsquo;d look over at her in the crib after she&amp;rsquo;d tricked me into thinking she was tired, only to find a big toothless smile and happy eyes looking back at me. What a cutie!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first reaction after several iterations of this was frustration, but this soon gave way to feelings of guilt. After all, these are the days that I should cherish! Soon she&amp;rsquo;ll be crawling and thereafter will start becoming more and more independent each day. That means what I have right now is so, so special. Having realized that yesterday towards the end of my (our?) ordeal, those feelings of frustration melted away, leaving me there to soak up the experience for what it was.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mindful Running Hacks</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/mindful-running-hacks/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2010 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/mindful-running-hacks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width: 640px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/rcsaxon/542566756/&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;Runners&#34; src=&#34;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1351/542566756_db45e39778_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Runners&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Image courtesy of Richard Saxon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love running; I&amp;rsquo;m a runner. On weekends, early in the morning, and even during my ever-decreasing lunch breaks, I run. I feel like it gives me the clairvoyance needed to tackle whatever problems I&amp;rsquo;m having in my life at the moment. As an example, right now I mostly focus on how to solve programming problems by putting them on the back-burner of my mind while my feet hit the pavement repeatedly. It&amp;rsquo;s therapeutic! It&amp;rsquo;s also a huge benefit to your body, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have to tell you that, right? There are a few problems that I have to consider when running, though. Long distance running can be a mind game in which winning means enjoying your run and losing means experiencing pure agony for each centimeter traveled. This post is about handling that mind game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that long distance running is completely relative to each person and their experience. I&amp;rsquo;m sure &amp;ldquo;long run&amp;rdquo; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Salazar&#34;&gt;Alberto Salazaar&lt;/a&gt; means 20+ miles in a single stretch. It can be relative on other things, too - 5 mile runs seem much longer when you are running in 90 degree, 80% humidity weather, don&amp;rsquo;t they! For purposes of this post my &amp;ldquo;long&amp;rdquo; runs are those of 5 miles or longer only because that seems to be a sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: when I&amp;rsquo;m running long distances, I tend to psych myself out when I think too much about how my body is performing. I get into an endless loop of assessment similar to the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How is my breathing - is it too rapid, too conversational?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How is the &amp;ldquo;chaffage&amp;rdquo; situation - are my armpits, legs, etc uncomfortable?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Am I getting enough water, carbs?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How am I doing on my target pace?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
While certainly useful in a long race, this constant checking and re-checking makes me &lt;strong&gt;too aware&lt;/strong&gt; of any degradations in my performance. Translation: by constantly assessing myself, I find that I actually decrease my performance. Not good! To remedy this self-imposed issue, I employ one or more of the following &amp;ldquo;mindful running hacks&amp;rdquo; to keep my mind in check and to get more enjoyment out of my runs. I call them mind&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; because they don&amp;rsquo;t really involve your physical self; these things deal exclusively with the battles you can have inside your mind when running long distances. Anyway, here goes&amp;hellip;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a mantra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
A mantra is something - a phrase, song, word - that you repeat over and over either physically or mentally to occupy your mind&amp;rsquo;s conscious thoughts; it&amp;rsquo;s really just a big distraction, not at all unlike when you think about your summer vacation (or other happy times) when you are in the dentist&amp;rsquo;s chair. I use mantras to zone out when running. I tend to go with some sort of positive or realistic phrase pertinent to my route. Examples:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This is how I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;supposed &lt;/em&gt;to feel&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;insert some lyrics of a song I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to here&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Calm, cool, collected, &lt;em&gt;confident&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;X (substitute X with whatever mile/km you are currently on)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I find they are effective as such, but relatively boring overall. This means that the longer my run is, the less likely I am to utilize this one. I have to break up the monotony, which leads me to my next point.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Break up the run into chunks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
I break down my long runs into manageable chunks, and I only focusing on one chunk at a time. In the middle of my 10 mile run, I think about the plethora of other 5 mile runs I&amp;rsquo;ve completed with no problem. I will myself to forget the miles that are increasingly behind me - what&amp;rsquo;s left is what matters, and what&amp;rsquo;s left is shrinking with each step! I find that I break down my runs into roughly half-mile increments. That&amp;rsquo;s probably a byproduct of my watch&amp;rsquo;s capacity to store lap information, but you can use whatever works for you.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Positive thinking, visualization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
I know, it sounds lame. But if it is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Cant-Accept-Not-Trying-Excellence/dp/0062511904/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1278002864&amp;amp;sr=8-3&#34;&gt;good enough for Michael Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be good enough for me? I envision my run before and during my actual run. This helps me anticipate how I am going to physically feel as I take step after step. Knowing what to expect mid-race makes me feel more in control, thus boosting my confidence. What I do is think mostly about how my body is going to handle the most difficult portions of a given route - that big up/downhill, the slippery rock or dirt section, etc.  - then I play that section in my head over and over. With repetition comes boredom, so when I actually encounter the obstacle I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem so bad.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Use Jeff Galloway&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;dirty tricks&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
I have a book called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Marathon-You-Can-Jeff-Galloway/dp/0936070250&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marathon: You Can Do It!&amp;rdquo; by Jeff Galloway&lt;/a&gt;, the running guru. In it he provides a couple of mind techniques to use that he calls &amp;ldquo;dirty tricks.&amp;rdquo; All of them are more or less distraction techniques, but I want to bear mention of them here. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried each with success, although with a slight bit of embarrassment. The good thing is that no one has to know - it&amp;rsquo;s all in your head!:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pretend that you and the person in front of you are lashed together with a giant rubber band. Envision the tension of that rubber band is propelling your body forward and past your opponent.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In an effort to decrease the influence of the right brain when running (which seems to be the dominant half when doing so, for some reason), do math or other analytical (non-logic) problems that help engage your left brain. The idea is to shift the balance between your left and right brains to keep your mind fresh.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Imagine a giant hand is guiding you through the difficult parts of the race, gently pushing you so as to relieve part of your strain.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Glide vs. Stride - switch up your stride every once in a while. Go from short, choppy strides to long ones where your feet barely clear the ground. Note: this one isn&amp;rsquo;t just a mental trick. The physical changes help your muscles go longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Get Angry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
When I really can&amp;rsquo;t get myself into gear, I imagine things that make me angry. I envision all of my friends laughing at my speed (or lack thereof) or I replay an embarrassing incident in my life. When I do this I feel the immediate need to improve; to prove that those incidents are behind me and I am now a better person. Really though, I tend to use this as a last resort because it is negative thinking.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In conclusion&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
So there you have it - my list of things I use to make my runs less mind-numbingly difficult. I find that if I use the things I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned here my long runs (those of 5 or more miles, but your YMMV) become enjoyable because I&amp;rsquo;m not endlessly diagnosing myself and my performance. Rather, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on generally positive thoughts or distracting myself altogether. Either way I see a net benefit in becoming more fit and enjoying it all the while!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keeping your sanity with an infant</title>
      <link>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/keeping-your-sanity/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2010 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ant Zucaro</author>
      <guid>https://chriswayg.github.io/posts/2010/keeping-your-sanity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Those of you who know me personally also know that I had a baby girl this past Easter (Layla, on &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). It has been a tiring, stressful, and &lt;em&gt;totally wonderful&lt;/em&gt; experience! What I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about specifically are the first two points (the tiring and the stressful) and four things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to cope with them. I hope these things will benefit you. If they do, great! If not&amp;hellip;well, forget about everything I said and go about doing whatever it was you were going to do anyway :). Here goes&amp;hellip;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Sleep when baby sleeps&lt;/h3&gt;
When my little girl is crying, my ability to properly diagnose the situation almost entirely depends on how rested I am. I know that the more rested I am, the more clear mind mind will be. Is she hungry? Is she too hot? Does she have gas? I&amp;rsquo;ll never figure it out if my mind is too cloudy. That means it is extremely important for me to get as much sleep as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therein lies the problem - you don&amp;rsquo;t have much time for sleep. At least I thought I didn&amp;rsquo;t at first. I learned after a few hard weeks that I had to lay down and sleep when Layla went down, else I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be sleeping at all. Surprisingly, the amount of sleep I was getting after a few weeks of doing this increased dramatically because I was better able to handle/fix whatever was bothering Layla. She&amp;rsquo;d been giving me the signs all along (turning her head when hungry, kicking her legs when gassy, etc) and I&amp;rsquo;d just been to tired (or too dumb) to pay attention. Addressing those issues quickly and correctly calmed her down and prevented &amp;ldquo;meltdowns,&amp;rdquo; which then increased her snooze-time.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make connections with other people in your same situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
My wife and I felt alone in the first few weeks after Layla was born. None of our close friends had newborns and we didnâ€™t feel comfortable going to a â€œmommyâ€ or â€œdaddyâ€ meetup in our city. We eventually sucked it up and started scheduling lunches and dinners with other parents who weâ€™d met through mutual friends or work. We figure that doing this created win-win situations for us: we get to talk with people who experience the same issues while making new friends at the same time. Who wouldâ€™ve thought (duh, right)? Plus, I developed a bunch of ideas (or avoided roadblocks altogether) through conversations with these new friends. They really are wonderful exchanges, with each side of the table contributing something or other that makes life with an infant just a little bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think all it took was that little connection with the outside world to make us feel like we were still part of something, instead of feeling like we were on an uninhabited island where no one else had kids.
&lt;h3&gt;3. Change up your scenery&lt;/h3&gt;
This really goes without saying, but I feel I have to say it anyway: you &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to change up your surroundings or else you are going to go insane. I am especially prone to cabin fever, but it seemed amplified knowing you have the weight of another human relying on  you 100% on your shoulders. For whatever reason, Kristin and I stayed in the house more often than not. I donâ€™t know what it was that kept us there for so long, but after a while we grew determined to make it easier to go out and about. We critically analyzed our process management science style, which resulted in the following decisions:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We opted against a traditional diaper bag, going with a backpack instead. We already owned a backpack (diaper bags are not cheap, by the way), and it allowed us to have two arms totally free to handle other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We got a portable changing pad like this [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.walmart.com/ip/Summer-Infant-ChangeAway-Portable-Changing-Pad-Diaper-Kit/12960886?sourceid=1500000000000003260330&amp;amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;amp;ci_sku=12960886&#34;&gt;http://www.walmart.com/ip/Summer-Infant-ChangeAway-Portable-Changing-Pad-Diaper-Kit/12960886?sourceid=1500000000000003260330&amp;amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;amp;ci_sku=12960886&lt;/a&gt;]  and pre-populated it with all of the change stuff weâ€™d need.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We bought a different, lighter weight stroller for the &amp;ldquo;quick trips&amp;rdquo; out. We love our Chicco, but it gets left at home when we&amp;rsquo;re heading to the mall.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Formula! We used to keep those freezer packs in our bag to keep the milk cold. Nowadays we just bring a pre-measured amount of formula along with bottles with the corresponding amount of water. Hungry baby? Mix, shake, and your done. Many thanks to our neighbors who let us borrow a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Sassy-Powdered-Formula-Dispenser-Multiple/dp/B000067PIZ/ref=pd_sbs_misc_2&#34;&gt;tupperware formula thingamajig&lt;/a&gt; to dispense the formula powder in the least messy fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
With these changes made, getting out of the house wasn&amp;rsquo;t such a big deal any more. Hooray!
&lt;h3&gt;4. Make daily goals for yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
Nothing feels better than checking things off of your TODO list. What I do is make little lists with what I want to accomplish during the day. These become my daily goals which made me feel good about my day when completed. Take note  - these aren&amp;rsquo;t mind-bendingly awesome goals or long term in any way, but rather simple things that moved my new life further a little bit at a time:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Folding the laundry (ugh, what a dreaded task)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Calling back a friend&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;De-cluttering my desk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
As Bill Murray says in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103241/&#34;&gt;What About Bob?&lt;/a&gt;: baby steps, baby steps! Checking off those baby steps - no matter how little -  feels &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been away from this little internet space for about two and a half years. Sorry about that. In my own defense, I was in grad school, purchasing a house, quitting jobs, finding other jobs, and watching movies (lots of movies). My goal from now on is to add content to this site regularly as a means to express myself and to own my own content. I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting under a couple of categories, the first two being &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;galleries.&amp;rdquo; They mean exactly what you think they mean - a &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; category post means a post contains the ramblings of my brain/personal opinion, howtos, geek stuff, etc etc. The &amp;ldquo;galleries&amp;rdquo; category means the post will be used to post my images. Simple, right? Right. I hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still deciding what to do with all of the older content (from college and what has been stagnant for the past 2.5 years). I may re-post, but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
